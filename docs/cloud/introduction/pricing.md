Temporal Cloud is a consumption-based service; you pay only for what you need when you need it. Pricing is flexible, transparent, and predictable, so you know your costs and never pay for unused capacity.

This page introduces the elements of Temporal Cloud pricing so that you can estimate costs for your implementation. To gain a reliable estimate, [contact our team](https://pages.temporal.io/contact-us).

## What is an Action? {#action}

Actions are the fundamental consumption pricing unit in Temporal Cloud.
An Action in Temporal occurs as part of an execution of your Workflow.
Each time you execute a Temporal Workflow (a Workflow Execution), the associated Actions are collected and ultimately represent the state and progress of your Temporal Application.

Actions are collected and billed monthly for each Namespace. The base rate is $25 per one million Actions, and you are billed only for the prorated amount of Actions you use. If you use fewer than one million Actions per month, your bill for Actions will be less than $25 for that month.

| **Actions per month** | **Cost per 1M (USD)** |
| --------------------- | --------------------- |
| Any number            | $25.00 (prorated)     |

Alternatively, Temporal also offers a credit system. Credits provide an additional discount schedule for both billable Actions and storage. Credits do not expire. The following table outlines cost estimates and discount bands for the credits system. Please reach out to the team if you are interested in this option.

| **Actions per month (millions)** | **Cost per 1M (USD)** | **Cost band**       | **Actions per second** |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------- |
| 0 to 299                         | $23.25                | $0–$7,500           | ~115                   |
| 300 to 1,499                     | $18.80                | $5,640–$28,200      | ~570                   |
| 1,500 to 7,499                   | $14.10                | $21,150–$105,750    | ~2,860                 |
| 7,500 to 29,999                  | $10.50                | $78,750–$315,000    | ~11,400                |
| 30,000 to 149,999                | $7.90                 | $237,000–$1,185,000 | ~57,000                |
| 150,000 or more                  | $5.90                 | Begins at $885,000  | n/a                    |

The following operations result in Actions.

## What are the Temporal Cloud storage prices? {#storage}

An execution of a particular Workflow could exist for a few seconds, a day, month, or even forever. Temporal collects the Event History during this time and dispatches work when necessary. In this context, a Workflow Execution has only two states, open (active) or closed.

Storage costs are measured in gigabyte-hours (GBh) and include charges for active Workflows, "running" storage, and the long-term, "retained" storage of Event Histories of closed Workflows. These are measured per Namespace.

Running storage is a measure of the amount of storage used to store active Workflows. When the execution of a Workflow ends, Temporal Cloud stores Event History for a defined Retention Period, for historical use. This is retained storage. Typical uses include compliance, debugging, workload refresh, and business analytics. Both kinds of storage have fixed costs.

| **Storage** | **Cost per GBh** |
| ----------- | ---------------- |
| Retained    | $0.00042         |
| Running     | $0.042           |

If you purchase Temporal Cloud credits (as outlined earlier), running storage costs are tiered and measured in gigabyte-hours.

| **Running storage** | **Cost per GBh** |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |
| Less than 10        | $0.042           |
| 10 to 39            | $0.031           |
| 40 to 119           | $0.023           |
| 120 to 499          | $0.018           |
| 500 to 1999         | $0.013           |
| 2000 or more        | $0.010           |

## What kind of support do I get with Temporal Cloud? {#support}

With a subscription to Temporal Cloud, you also gain access to our support organization of developer success engineers and solution architects. Our experts assist with a range of work streams from Workflow design reviews to setting up observability to break/fix support with an agreed-upon set of SLAs.

The Temporal Developer Success team brings a deep knowledge of how Temporal works and how you can optimize your deployment. This team is comprised of engineers who know Temporal inside and out, and continue to contribute to its development.

They also investigate your Workflows to optimize their environments and possibly reduce costs associated with Actions and storage. They ensure your instance is performance tuned and help with other ongoing maintenance, like upgrades of the Temporal software and maintenance of the platform.

If an issue occurs, the team provides support through our [support portal](/cloud/introduction/support#support-ticket) <span id="i-1f161b3c-45d5-432c-861c-0177039b0cd3" class="clickable-i clickable-link-preview">i</span><div id="preview-modal-1f161b3c-45d5-432c-861c-0177039b0cd3" class="preview-modal"><div class="modal-header"><div id="x-1f161b3c-45d5-432c-861c-0177039b0cd3" class="clickable-x clickable-link-preview">x</div><b>Link preview:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp<a href="/cloud/introduction/support#support-ticket">/cloud/introduction/support#support-ticket</a></div><div class="preview-modal-title">How to create a ticket for Temporal Support</div><div class="preview-modal-description">To request assistance from Temporal Support, create a ticket in Zendesk.</div><div class="preview-modal-tags"><a class="preview-modal-tag" href="/tags/temporal-cloud">temporal-cloud</a> <a class="preview-modal-tag" href="/tags/support">support</a> <a class="preview-modal-tag" href="/tags/how-to">how-to</a></div></div>, [community forum](https://community.temporal.io/), and (with Premium support) a dedicated Slack channel. Temporal offers two levels of support defined by their availability and SLAs.

|                     | **Basic**                                                                                   | **Premium**                                                                            |

Business hours for Temporal Support are 0500–1700 Monday–Friday (Pacific Time).
For P0 issues, coverage is 24×7.

## What is the price for SSO and SAML? {#sso-and-saml}

We offer single sign-on (SSO) integration using SAML at a monthly fixed fee based on the number of users registered in Temporal Cloud:

| **Users** | **Cost per month** |
| --------- | ------------------ |
| 0 to 25   | $200               |
| 26 to 50  | $300               |
| 51+       | $500               |

## How to estimate costs {#pricing-estimates}

Temporal Cloud employs a consumption-based pricing model that's based on storage and execution, factors that vary from one Workflow to the next. You can estimate the cost of a specific Workflow by running it at a low volume and then using its storage and compute measurements to project your production-scale cost. Our team is happy to [help you estimate the cost](https://pages.temporal.io/contact-us) for your specific workloads.

## Pricing FAQ {#pricing-faq}
