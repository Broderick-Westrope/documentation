In the world of modern applications, low latency is crucial for delivering seamless user experiences. 
For developers, ensuring minimal delay in Workflow Execution can make a significant difference in application performance and user satisfaction. 
Temporal provides features that significantly reduce latency, making your applications faster and more efficient.

Temporal Cloud includes architectural advancements like a custom persistence layer, which reduce latency effectively.
Benchmarks have shown that application-side latency is lower when using Temporal Cloud. For example, Temporal Cloud completes workflows nearly twice as fast as self-hosted instances.

Temporal Cloud’s architecture includes a custom persistence layer with three key components:

- **Better Sharding:** Dynamic sharding of persistent state across multiple databases allows for independent resizing, improving scalability and handling high-traffic events.
- **Write-Ahead Log (WAL):** This log stores writes in an append-only format, reducing latency and database size by batching updates before writing to the database.
- **Tiered Storage of Workflow Event History:** Moving completed Workflow Event Histories to an object store reduces database load, improving efficiency and latency for running Workflows.

Temporal Cloud provides lower latency, making it suitable for latency-sensitive, large-scale, or business-critical applications.
Temporal Cloud also offers a lower price per performance compared to self-hosted Temporal due to its architectural efficiencies and consumption-based costs.
