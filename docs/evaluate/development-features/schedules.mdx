Schedules in Temporal allow you to control the timing of your Workflow executions, enabling you to handle time-sensitive tasks with precision.
By scheduling Workflows, you can automate repetitive tasks, reduce the need for manual intervention, and ensure the timely execution of your business processes.

Temporal's scheduling capabilities provide a robust framework for managing Workflow executions.
With schedules, you can create, backfill, delete, describe, list, pause, trigger, and update Workflow executions, giving you complete control over your automation processes.
Whether you need to schedule a Workflow to run at regular intervals or at a specific future time, Temporal makes it easy to ensure your Workflows are executed exactly when needed.
