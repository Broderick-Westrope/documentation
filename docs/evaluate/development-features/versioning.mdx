Versioning in Temporal is a feature that allows safely evolve your Temporal application code in production.
Developers can make changes to their application code without causing non-deterministic behavior in current long-running Workflows. 

Workflow Versioning allows you to safely deploy incompatible changes to your Workflow code.
This is especially important when you have Workflow Executions that were started with the original code and are still running when you deploy the updated code.

Depending on your use case, the longevity of your Workflow Executions, and your organizational overhead, you can implement Versioning by changing Workflow Types or by using the Patching API. 

Versioning is invaluable as it ensures that your Workflows remain stable and consistent, even as you update and improve your application code.
This flexibility ensures that your long-running Workflows can continue seamlessly, regardless of code changes.
