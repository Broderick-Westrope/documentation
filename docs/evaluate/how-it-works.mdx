Temporal offers an entirely new way to build scalable and reliable applications.

## Build Invincible Apps 

Temporal ensures your applications are reliable by default, handling everything from minor network outages to significant issues like unexpected reboots or hardware failures.
By offloading the responsibility of failure management from the application to the platform, this removes the need for extensive coding, testing, and maintenance tasks.

This shift simplifies the development process and enables your application to seamlessly recover from disruptions.
It does so by automatically reconstructing its previous state.
Your application logic can be recovered, replayed, or paused from any previous point in your application, ensuring continuity even after failures.

## Temporal Application: The Building Blocks

In a Temporal application, the code you write is made up of Workflows and Activities. 

### Workflow

Conceptually, a workflow is a sequence of steps. 
You've likely encountered workflows in your daily life, whether it's:
- Using a mobile app to transfer money
- Purchasing concert tickets
- Booking a vacation
- Ordering a meal delivery
- Filing an expense report
- Creating a new employee onboarding process

In Temporal, a Workflow defines the steps your application takes to complete a task, much like a blueprint for your application. 
It’s the heart of your business logic, written in code, outlining each step in your process. 
This could be moving money between bank accounts, processing orders, deploying cloud infrastructure, or training an AI model. 

Temporal isn’t a no-code workflow engine. 
It is a **Workflows-as-Code** approach to creating applications 
Instead of dragging and dropping steps in a visual interface, you write your Workflows in code in your favorite programming language, code editor, and other tools. 
This gives you full control and flexibility over your business processes, allowing you to build exactly what you need. 

Workflows are resilient and stateful. 
With Temporal, they are built to handle problems smoothly. 
They can pause, pick up where they left off, or try again automatically. 
If a failure or a crash happens, this ensures that your business processes keep running without interruptions.

### Activities
Activities are the individual tasks within your Workflow.

They handle jobs that interact with the outside world, like sending an email, making a network request, writing to a database, or calling an API. 
These tasks are where issues might occur, such as network failures or service errors. 
Activities are pieces of code, either functions or methods depending on the programming language, that perform these tasks. 
Activities are invoked in Workflow code. 

If an Activity fails, Temporal automatically retries it based on your configuration. 
You have full control over how often and how many times these retries should happen. 
You can also define specific timeouts for each Activity, triggering a retry if the task takes too long to complete.

### SDKs
Developers create Temporal applications by writing code, just like you would to create any other software. 
To do this, you use an Temporal SDK, which stands for software development kit. 

The Temporal SDK is an open source library that developers install in their application to use Temporal. 
It provides everything needed to build Workflows, Activities, and various other features in a specific programming language.

Temporal currently offers six SDKs: Java, Go, TypeScript, .NET, Python, and PHP. 
Installing the SDK allows you to easily add Temporal to your current projects without having to change the tools you're already using. 
Temporal fits right into your existing tech stack without any hassle.

The Temporal SDK also makes it easier to implement complex tasks such as handling jobs either in order or at the same time (sync/async execution), automatically retrying failed tasks, scheduling tasks to run regularly, managing complex workflows (SAGA compensation), and managing errors (advanced error handling).

## Temporal Service 

Temporal has two main parts:
1. Your application (with Workflows and Activities)
2. The Temporal Service (a set of services and components)

At the heart of Temporal's architecture is the Temporal Service, which provides durability, scalability, and reliability for your application.
It communicates with the application, manages tasks, and maintains a detailed history of each event, which it durably persists to a database.
The Temporal Service manages critical tasks like making an API call or updating a database, by making sure they get executed, and then recording their completion.

One of the biggest advantages of the Temporal Service is how it handles failures. 
The Temporal Service maintains a meticulous log of every step in your Workflows. 
By keeping a history of every step in your Workflow, it ensures that even if something goes wrong — your Workflow can continue from the last successful point. 
The Temporal Service knows exactly where to resume without losing any work. 
This saves you from having to write complex error-handling code or recovery mechanisms yourself. 

You can run the Temporal Service on your own infrastructure or use Temporal Cloud, a managed service that handles operational overhead and offers scalability and expert support.

## Workers
The real strength of Temporal comes from the combination of your application and the Temporal Service. 
A Worker is a component within your application and provided by the Temporal SDK. 
Workers execute the actual tasks defined in your Workflows. The Temporal Service tracks and coordinates these Workers. 

Whenever your application needs to perform a task, like sending a notification or calling an processing a payment, the Temporal Service steps in. 
This process creates a clear, organized list of what needs to be done. 
It hands off tasks to these Workers, making sure they’re done correctly and efficiently while it keeps track of their progress. 
Workers which are part of your application then carry out the tasks and run your code. 
This collaboration is crucial for building reliable, scalable, and durable applications. 
You can run multiple Workers — often dozens, hundreds, or even thousands — to improve application performance and scalability.

## Recovering from Failure

In any complex system, failures are bound to happen, but how they are handled makes all the difference. 
Temporal ensures that these failures don’t disrupt your application. 
This reliability is achieved through **Durable Execution**.

In a traditional non-Temporal application, if a crash occurs, the progress of your Workflow is often lost. 
The application has no memory of what happened before the failure, requiring extensive error-handling and recovery code to resume. 
This process is time-consuming and error-prone, making it hard to ensure reliability.

With Temporal, if your Workflow crashes, it automatically recreates its pre-crash state and continues as if the failure never happened. 
If a Temporal Application terminates prematurely, a Worker automatically reconstructs the state using data from the Event History. 
Event History is a detailed log that records every significant action or decision made by the Workflow. 
Temporal automatically saves and restores your application's state, so you don't have to juggle that yourself.
This means your application can keep running for days, weeks, or even years, even if the underlying infrastructure fails.

## Conclusion
Temporal provides effortless reliability, allowing applications to run for days, weeks, or even years without interruption. 
Temporal supports multiple programming languages and simplifies state management. 
With Temporal, you don't have to write tons of extra code to handle every possible thing that could go wrong. 
Temporal scales up easily, making sure everything runs smoothly, no matter how big your application gets. 

Temporal also represents a paradigm shift in software development. 
It's not just about making existing patterns more reliable; it's about enabling entirely new approaches to building complex, distributed systems. 
Developers can focus on business logic rather than infrastructure concerns and create applications that are inherently scalable and maintainable.
Any business process that must be reliable and scalable is a potential candidate for Temporal, but common use cases include order processing, customer onboarding, and payment processing.
