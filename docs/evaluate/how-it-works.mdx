Temporal offers an entirely new way to build scalable and reliable applications.
Imagine if you could write code that was naturally resilient to failures, could run for extended periods, and could easily manage complex, long-running processes. 

That's what Temporal offers - not just a tool, but a whole new way of thinking about and writing software.
Temporal is an open-source platform that ensures your applications keep running, no matter what.


## Build Invincible Apps 

Temporal ensures your applications are reliable by default, handling everything from minor network outages to significant issues like unexpected reboots or hardware failures.
By offloading the responsibility of failure management from the application to the platform, this removes the need for extensive coding, testing, and maintenance tasks.

This shift simplifies the development process and enables your application to seamlessly recover from disruptions.
It does so by automatically reconstructing its previous state.
Your application logic can be recovered, replayed, or paused from any previous point in your workflow, ensuring continuity even after failures.

This is Temporal's ability to ensure that your code executes to completion, even in the face of failures or long delays (i.e - Durable Execution). 
It means your application can pick up right where it left off, even if a computer crashes or the power goes out.


### Temporal Application: The Building Blocks

Temporal uses two main concepts. In a Temporal application, the code you write is made up of Workflows and Activities. 

#### Workflow

Conceptually, a workflow is a sequence of steps. 
You've likely encountered workflows in your daily life, whether it's:
- Using a mobile app to transfer money
- Purchasing concert tickets
- Booking a vacation
- Ordering a meal delivery
- Filing an expense report
- Creating a new employee onboarding process

In Temporal, a Workflow defines the steps your application takes to complete a task, much like a blueprint for your application. 
It’s the heart of your business logic, written in code, outlining each step in your process. 
This could be moving money between bank accounts, processing orders, deploying cloud infrastructure, or training an AI model. 

Temporal isn’t a no-code workflow engine. 
It is **workflow-as-code**. 
Instead of dragging and dropping steps in a visual interface, you write your workflows in code in your favorite programming language. 
This gives you full control and flexibility over your business processes, allowing you to build exactly what you need.


Workflows are resilient and stateful. 
With Temporal, they are built to handle problems smoothly. 
They can pause, pick up where they left off, or try again automatically. 
If a failure or a crash happens, this ensures that your business processes keep running without interruptions.

#### Activities
Activities are the individual tasks within your Workflow.

They handle jobs that interact with the outside world, like sending an email, making a network request, writing to a database, or calling an API. 
These tasks are where issues might occur, such as network failures or service errors. 
Activities are pieces of code, either functions or methods depending on the programming language, that perform these tasks. 
Activities are invoked in Workflow code. 


### SDKs
Developers create Temporal applications by writing code, just like they would to create any other software. 
To do this, they use the Temporal SDK, which stands for software development kit. 

The Temporal SDK is an open source library that developers install in their application to use Temporal. 
It provides everything needed and the framework to build Workflows, Activities, and various other features in a specific programming language.

Temporal currently offers six SDKs: Java, Go, TypeScript, .NET, Python, and PHP. Installing the SDK makes it possible to use Temporal in that language. 
This allows you to easily add Temporal to their current projects without having to change the tools you're already using, fitting right into the way you already work.

### Temporal Service: The Engine Behind the Scenes

Temporal has two main parts:
1. Your application (with Workflows and Activities)
2. The Temporal Service

Temporal consists of two components, the [Temporal Service](/evaluate/major-components#temporal-service) and an SDK in your preferred language such as Go, .NET, Java, Python, PHP, or Typescript.
The Temporal Service logs the progress and state of your application.
Once the application finishes executing the Activity, it communicates with the Temporal Service, which records the Activity's completion in the Workflow's Event History.
The Activity invocation is handled by the Temporal Service.
The Temporal Service updates the Event History and creates a Task for executing the Activity.

The Temporal Service records every event in the Workflow’s lifecycle, so that the Workflow can continue from the last successful state in the case of a failure
The Temporal Service schedules the Activity and creates a Task, which is picked up and executed by a Worker.

A Temporal Application gains its durability, scalability, and reliability from the support provided by the Temporal Service. 
However, the Temporal Service doesn't actually run the Workflow and Activity functions. 
A Worker, which is part of the application and is provided by the Temporal SDK, is responsible for running that code. 
It's typical to run multiple Workers, since doing so can improve the application's performance and scalability. 
In a production environment, the Workers and Temporal Service are usually deployed on different machines.

Temporal Cloud
You can either run this service yourself or use Temporal Cloud, where experts take care of it for you.
Temporal Cloud is a managed service that provides a scalable and highly available Temporal Service.
There are two options for using Temporal Service: You can run it yourself or you can use our Temporal Cloud service. 
Temporal Cloud relieves customers from the operational burden of self-hosting. In addition to reliability and peace of mind, they can depend on the support provided by our Developer Success team. 
They'll also benefit from the high performance made possible by CDS, the custom persistence layer we built specifically for Temporal Cloud.

The Worker runs the Workflow and Activity code. The Worker is the component that runs both the Workflow and Activity code.

### Recovering from Failure

**Retries and timeouts**

Distributed systems are complex—requests can fail, systems can crash, and services may get overloaded. 
Temporal’s most valuable feature is how it simplifies error handling, including retries and timeouts.

If an Activity fails—for any reason—Temporal will automatically retry that Activity for you. 
You can configure exactly how Temporal should perform retries – how often and how many times. 
Temporal also provides options for when Activities should time out and then be retried. 
Each Activity can be configured independently, giving you maximum control without requiring custom code.

**Application State**

During execution, applications transition through various changes in their state, during which the values of variables in the code are updated to reflect the progress made. 
With a non-Temporal application, by default, that state will be lost if the application terminates prematurely, which might happen due to a bug in the code, a power outage, or a hardware failure. 
If a Temporal Application terminates prematurely, however, a Worker automatically reconstructs the state using data from the Event History. 
It then resumes the execution, as if the termination never even happened.

A Temporal Workflow is a process or sequence of events you want to make sure will execute reliably.
They can run—and keep running—for years, even if the underlying infrastructure fails.
If the execution of your Workflow code crashes, Temporal automatically recreates its pre-crash state, allowing the Workflow to continue execution as if it never even happened.
Temporal provides built-in solutions for timers, event sourcing, state checkpointing, retries, and timeouts, removing the necessity for custom implementations.

## Common Misconceptions

The Temporal Service does not execute your code!

Your application code, including Workers, Workflows, and Activities, lives on your computers. 
The code is written in your favorite SDK language. 
None of that code runs on the Temporal Service.

### With Temporal 
**Effortless Reliability:** You don't have to write tons of extra code to handle every possible thing that could go wrong. 
Temporal handles failures and retries for you, so you don't have to write complex error-handling code.

**Handles Long-Running Processes:** Your app can keep running for days, weeks, or even years, even if computers restart or networks fail.
Your application can keep running for days, weeks, or even years without problems.
You can write code that runs for days or weeks as easily as code that runs for seconds.

**Works with Many Languages:** Temporal supports several programming languages, so more developers can use it.
In addition to using their favorite programming language with Temporal, our "Workflows-as-Code" approach to creating applications means that developers can use their favorite code editor and other tools.
Temporal supports several programming languages, including Java, Python, C#, Typescript, and Go.

**Powerful Monitoring:** Temporal provides tools to watch how your application is doing and fix issues quickly.

**Simplified State Management:** Temporal automatically saves and restores your app's state, so you don't have to juggle that yourself.


## Developer Productivity and Overview
Temporal provides durable execution for your code
• Automatically maintains application state and recovers from failure
• Provides built-in support for managing retries and timeouts
• Improves productivity by making applications easier to develop, scale, and support
• Temporal applications are created using Workflows

It allows developers to focus on business logic rather than infrastructure concerns.
It makes building distributed systems and microservices significantly easier and more reliable.

Temporal represents a paradigm shift in software development. 
It's not just about making existing patterns more reliable; it's about enabling entirely new approaches to building complex, distributed systems. 
By adopting Temporal, developers can create applications that are inherently more scalable, and maintainable.

Temporal is an open source Durable Execution platform. 
It guarantees that applications run to completion, despite situations that might otherwise cause them to fail. 
Any business process that must be reliable and scalable is a potential candidate for Temporal, but common use cases include order processing, customer onboarding, and payment processing.
