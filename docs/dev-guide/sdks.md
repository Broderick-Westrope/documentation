Temporal SDKs (software development kits) are an open source collection of tools, libraries, and APIs that enable Temporal Application development.

They offer a [Temporal Client](#temporal-client) to interact with the [Temporal Cluster](/clusters#), APIs to develop your [Temporal Application](#temporal-application), and APIs to run horizontally scalable [Workers](/workers#worker).

SDKs are more than just a development tool, however.
The SDK APIs enable developers to write code in a particular pattern that mirrors real world processes.
The SDK's internal implementation, working in collaboration with the Temporal Cluster, steps through that code, guaranteeing execution progression during application runtime.

## What is a Temporal Application? {#temporal-application}

A Temporal Application is the code you write, comprised of [Workflow Definitions](/workflows#workflow-definition), [Activity Definitions](/workflows#workflow-definition), code used to configure [Temporal Clients](#temporal-client), and code used to configure and start [Workers](/workers#worker).
Developers create Temporal Applications using an [official Temporal SDK](#official-sdks).

Consider that the Workflow Definition code can be executed repeatedly.
The Temporal Platform can concurrently support millions to billions of Workflow Executions, each of which representing an invoked Workflow Definition.

Additionally, a Temporal Workflow Execution is both resumable and recoverable, and it can react to external events.

- Resumable: The ability of a process to resume execution after suspending on an _awaitable_.
- Recoverable: The ability of a process to resume execution after suspending due to a _failure_.
- Reactive: The ability of a process to respond to external events.

Hence, a Temporal Application can run for seconds or years in the presence of arbitrary load and failures.

## Official SDKs {#official-sdks}

**What are the officially supported SDKs?**

Each Temporal SDK targets a specific programming language.

- [Go SDK developer's guide](/dev-guide/go/introduction#)
- [Java SDK developer's guide](/dev-guide/java/introduction#)
- [PHP SDK developer's guide](/dev-guide/php)
- [Python SDK developer's guide](/dev-guide/python/introduction#)
- [TypeScript developer's guide](/dev-guide/typescript/introduction#)
- [.NET API reference](https://dotnet.temporal.io/)

Despite supporting multiple languages, and supporting many features, Temporal SDKs aim to make developers feel at home in their language.

## Why use a Temporal SDK? {#why-use-an-sdk}

Temporal SDKs empowers developers to concentrate on creating dependable and scalable business logic, alleviating the need to build home grown supervisor systems to ensure reliability and fault-tolerance. This is possible because the Temporal SDK provides a unified library that abstracts the intricacies of how Temporal handles distributed systems.

### Development pattern

By abstracting complexities and streamlining boilerplate code, developers can craft straightforward code that directly aligns with their business logic, enhancing code readability and bolstering developer productivity.

Consider a bank loan application.
Developers can design the business logic of a bank loan using the Temporal SDK.
The Workflow defines the overarching business logic, encompassing tasks such as validating applicant information, credit checks, loan approval, and applicant notifications, as Activities.

:::caution Do not copy and use code

The following is psuedocode, for tested samples see your langauge SDK's developer's guide.

:::

```
func LoanApplicationWorkflow {

    sdk.ExecuteActivity(CreditCheck)

    sdk.ExecuteActivity(AutomatedApproval)

    sdk.ExecuteActivity(NotifyApplicant)

    // ...
}
```

For instance, Temporal SDKs provide libraries for Workflow and Activities incorporate built-in support for handling failures, timeouts, and retries.
In the event of an Activity failure, the SDK automatically initiates retries according to configurable policies established by the developer within the SDK. This streamlined process simplifies the integration of fault-tolerance mechanisms into applications.

:::caution Do not copy and use code

The following is psuedocode, for tested samples see your langauge SDK's developer's guide.

:::

```
func LoanApplicationWorkflow {

    options = {
        MaxAttempts: 3,
        StartToCloseTimeout: 30min,
        HeartbeatTimeout: 10min,
    }

    sdk.ExecuteActivity(CreditCheck, options)

    sdk.ExecuteActivity(AutomatedApproval)

    sdk.ExecuteActivity(NotifyApplicant)

    // ...
}
```

### Replays

Another quality of the SDKs lies in their ability to replay Workflow Executions, a complex operation that contributes significantly to the Platform's promised reliability.

<div class="tdiw"><div class="tditw"><p class="tdit">The SDKs Replay code execution to continue from the last step</p></div><div class="tdiiw"><img class="img_ev3q" src="/diagrams/replay-basic.svg" alt="The SDKs Replay code execution to continue from the last step" height="338" width="1401" /></div></div>

We will delve into this idea more later, but for now, it signifies that the SDKs can automatically continue a process from the point of interruption, should a failure occur.
This capability stems from the SDK's ability to persist each step the program takes.

## Temporal SDKs major components {#major-components}

**What are the major components of Temporal SDKs?**

Temporal SDKs offer developers the following:

- A Temporal Client to communicate with a Temporal Cluster
- APIs to develop application code (Workflows & Activities)
- APIs to configure and run Workers

<div class="tdiw"><div class="tditw"><p class="tdit">Temporal SDK components create a runtime across your environment and a Temporal Cluster</p></div><div class="tdiiw"><img class="img_ev3q" src="/diagrams/temporal-sdk-components.svg" alt="Temporal SDK components create a runtime across your environment and a Temporal Cluster" height="870" width="1246" /></div></div>

Letâ€™s break down each one.

### Temporal Client

A Temporal Client acts as the bridge for communication between your applications and the Cluster.
The Client performs key functions that facilitate the execution of, management of, and communication with Workflows.

The following code is an example using the Go SDK.
It showcases how to initialize a Temporal Client, create a connection to a local Temporal Cluster, and start a Workflow Execution:

:::caution Do not copy and use code

The following code is for example purposes only.
For tested code samples and best practices, use your preferred language SDK's developer's guide.

:::

```go
package main

import (
	"context"

	"go.temporal.io/sdk/client"
)

func main() {
	// Temporal Client setup code
	c, err := client.NewClient(client.Options{})
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalln("Unable to create client", err)
	}
	defer c.Close()
	// Prepare Workflow option and parameters
	workflowOptions := client.StartWorkflowOptions{
		ID:        "loan-application-1",
		TaskQueue: "loan-application-task-queue",
	}
	applicantDetails := ApplicantDetails{
		// ...
	}
	// Start the Workflow
	workflowRun, err := c.ExecuteWorkflow(context.Background(), workflowOptions, "loan-application-workflow", applicantDetails)
	if err != nil {
		// ...
	}
	// ...
}
```

Developers can then use the Client as the main entry point for interacting with the application through Temporal.
Using that Client, developers may for example start or Signal Workflows, Query a Workflow's state, etc.
We can see in the example above how the developer has used `ExecuteWorkflow` API to start a Workflow.

### APIs to Develop Workflows

Workflows are defined as code: either a function or an object method, depending on the language.

For example, the following is a valid Temporal Workflow in Go:

:::caution Do not copy and use code

The following code is for example purposes only.
For tested code samples and best practices, use your preferred language SDK's developer's guide.

:::

```go
func LoanApplication(ctx context.Context) (error) {
    // ...
	return nil
}
```

The Workflow code uses Temporal SDK APIs to orchestrate the steps of the application.

:::caution Do not copy and use code

The following code is for example purposes only.
For tested code samples and best practices, use your preferred language SDK's developer's guide.

:::

```go
func LoanApplication(ctx workflow.Context, input *LoanApplicationWorkflowInput) (*LoanApplicationWorkflowResult, error) {
	// ...
	var result activities.CreditCheckResult
	f := workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, a.CreditCheck, CreditCheckInput(*input))
	err := f.Get(ctx, &result)
	// ...
	// Return the results
	return &loanApplicationResults, nil
}
```

A Workflow executes Activities (other functions that interact with external systems), handles and sends messages (Queries, Signals, Updates), and interacts with other Workflows.

This Workflow code, while executing, can be paused, resumed, and migrated across physical machines without losing state.

When a Workflow calls the API to execute an Activity, the Worker sends a [Command](https://docs.temporal.io/references/commands) back to the Cluster. The Cluster creates Activity Tasks in response which the same or a different Worker can then pick up and begin executing. In this way, the Worker and Cluster work together to incrementally execute Workflow code in a reliable way.
We discuss this more in detail in [How the SDKs work] section.

The SDK APIs also enable developers to write code that more genuinely maps to their process. This is because without a specialized SDK, developers might have to write a lot of boilerplate code. This can lead to code that's hard to maintain, difficult to understand, or that doesn't directly correspond to the underlying business process.

For example, the bank loan application Workflow might actually look like this:

:::caution Do not copy and use code

The following code is for example purposes only.
For tested code samples and best practices, use your preferred language SDK's developer's guide.

:::

```go
// LoanApplicationWorkflow is the workflow definition.
func LoanApplicationWorkflow(ctx workflow.Context, applicantName string, loanAmount int) (string, error) {
	// Step 1: Notify the applicant that the application process has started
	err := workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, NotifyApplicantActivity, applicantName, "Application process started").Get(ctx, nil)
	if err != nil {
		return "", err
	}

	// Step 2: Perform a credit check
	var creditCheckResult string
	err = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, LoanCreditCheckActivity, loanAmount).Get(ctx, &creditCheckResult)
	if err != nil {
		return "", err
	}

	// Step 3: Perform an automatic approval check
	var approvalCheckResult string
	err = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, AutomaticApprovalCheckActivity, creditCheckResult).Get(ctx, &approvalCheckResult)
	if err != nil {
		return "", err
	}

	// Step 4: Notify the applicant of the decision
	var notificationResult string
	err = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, NotifyApplicantActivity, applicantName, approvalCheckResult).Get(ctx, &notificationResult)
	if err != nil {
		return "", err
	}

	return notificationResult, nil
}
```

The level of abstraction that APIs offer enables the developer to focus on business logic without having to worry about the intricacies of distributed computing such as retries, or having to explicitly maintain a state machine and the intermediate state for each step of the process.

Additionally, the state of the Workflow is automatically persisted so if a failure does occur, it resumes right where it left off.

### APIs to create and manage Worker Processes

Workers are responsible for executing Workflow and Activity code (application code). The SDK provides APIs for configuring and starting Workers, enabling developers to control how the code is executed.
Workers are horizontally scalable, often run with systems like Kubernetes, and configured according to the applicationâ€™s needs.

Here is an example of how you could initialize a Worker using the Go SDK.

:::caution Do not copy and use code

The following code is for example purposes only.
For tested code samples and best practices, use your preferred language SDK's developer's guide.

:::

```go
func main() {
    // Create the client object just once per process
    c, err := client.NewClient(client.Options{})
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalln("Unable to create Temporal client", err)
    }
    defer c.Close()

    // Create the Worker instance
    w := worker.New(c, "loan-application-task-queue", worker.Options{})

    // Register the workflow and activity with the worker
    w.RegisterWorkflow(LoanApplicationWorkflow)
    w.RegisterActivity(LoanCreditCheck)

    // Start listening to the Task Queue
    err = w.Run(worker.InterruptCh())
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalln("Unable to start Worker", err)
    }
}
```

The Worker polls on the specified Task Queue, processing those Tasks, and reporting the results back to the Temporal Cluster. They execute both the Workflows and Activities, and the SDK ensures that they perform these tasks efficiently and reliably.

### APIs to customize Activity Execution behavior

Activities in Temporal are individual units of work that often represent non-deterministic parts of the code logic, such as querying a database or calling an external service. The SDK provides APIs to customize the behavior of an Activity Execution.

By default, if an Activity attempts to communicate with another system and encounters a transient failure like a network issue, Temporal ensures the Activity is tried again automatically.

However, Temporal enables developers to control a variety of timeouts, a Retry Policy, Heartbeat monitoring, and asynchronous completion.

The following code is an example of a custom set of Activity Execution options that affect the timeout and retry behavior of the execution, should the Activity encounter a failure.

This code is for example purposes only; for best practices and tested samples, use the developerâ€™s guide.

:::caution Do not copy and use code

The following code is for example purposes only.

```go
// LoanApplicationWorkflow is the Workflow Definition.
func LoanApplicationWorkflow(ctx workflow.Context, applicantName string, loanAmount int) (string, error) {
    // ...
    var creditCheckResult string
    // set a Retry Policy
    ao := workflow.ActivityOptions{
		ScheduleToCloseTimeout: time.Hour,
		HeartbeatTimeout:       time.Minute,
		RetryPolicy:            &temporal.RetryPolicy{
			InitialInterval:    time.Second,
			BackoffCoefficient: 2,
			MaximumInterval:    time.Minute,
			MaximumAttempts:    5,
		},
	}
    ctx = workflow.WithActivityOptions(ctx, ao)
    err = workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, LoanCreditCheckActivity, loanAmount).Get(ctx, &creditCheckResult)
    if err != nil {
        return "", err
    }
	// ...
    return notificationResult, nil
}

// LoanCreditCheckActivity is an Activity function that performs a credit check.
func LoanCreditCheckActivity(ctx context.Context, loanAmount int) (string, error) {
	// ... your logic here ...
	return "Credit check passed", nil
}
```

## The SDK and Temporal Cluster relationship {#sdk-and-cluster-relationship}

**How do the Temporal SDKs work with the Temporal Cluster?**

The Temporal Cluster functions more as a choreographer than a conductor. Rather than directly assigning tasks to Workers, the Cluster arranges the Tasks into a Task Queue while Workers poll the Task Queue. Developers may create a fleet of Workers and tune them so that a Task is picked up as soon as it is available. If a Worker goes down, Tasks can wait until the next Worker is available.

A Workflow might request to execute an Activity, start a Timer, or start a Child Workflow, each of which translates into a Command, dispatched to the Temporal Cluster.
In addition to acting on these Commands, the Cluster documents that interaction by appending their corresponding Events into to the Workflow Execution's Event History.

Take for instance the call to execute an Activity. When a Workflow invokes it, the Worker doesnâ€™t immediately execute that Activity code. Instead, it generates a ScheduleActivityTask Command, dispatching it to the Cluster. In response, the Cluster queues up a new Activity Task. Only when a Worker finds itself free, it collects the task and begins executing the Activity code.

The Cluster persists Workflow Execution Event History, so that if there is a failure, the SDK Worker is able to Replay the execution and resume where it left off.

This is where the deterministic constraints of the Workflow code comes into play, requiring the use of Activities to create side effects and interact with the outside world.

Letâ€™s look at an example Workflow with a single Activity.

```go
func LoanApplication(ctx workflow.Context, input *LoanApplicationWorkflowInput) (*LoanApplicationWorkflowResult, error) {

	ctx = workflow.WithActivityOptions(ctx, workflow.ActivityOptions{
		StartToCloseTimeout: time.Minute,
	})

	var result activities.NotifyApplicantActivityResult
	f := workflow.ExecuteActivity(ctx, a.NotifyApplicantActivity, NotifyApplicantActivityInput(*input))

	err := f.Get(ctx, &result)

	// Return the results
	return &l.LoanApplicationState, nil
}

type Activities struct {}

func (a *Activities) NotifyApplicantActivity(ctx context.Context, input *NotifyApplicantActivityInput) (*NotifyApplicantActivityResult, error) {
	var result NotifyApplicantActivityResult

	// Call the thirdparty API and handle the result

	return &result, err
}
```

The Activity above is performing a single call to an external API. Since the call can fail due to transient issues, we define it outside of the Workflow and provide it with retry options.

When you create a new Worker process, the Worker creates a long-lasting connection to the Cluster, polling a Task Queue for Tasks that related to the code it is capable of executing.

<div class="tdiw"><div class="tditw"><p class="tdit">A Worker long polls for Tasks</p></div><div class="tdiiw"><img class="img_ev3q" src="/diagrams/how-sdk-works-1.svg" alt="A Worker long polls for Tasks" height="661" width="1481" /></div></div>

Although the Worker is now running, unless a Workflow is explicitly started, the Task Queue doesn't have any Tasks on it and so, no code executes.
We can use a Temporal Client (Available in Temporal SDKs and the CLI) to start a new Workflow.

<div class="tdiw"><div class="tditw"><p class="tdit">Start a Workflow using a Temporal Client</p></div><div class="tdiiw"><img class="img_ev3q" src="/diagrams/how-sdk-works-2.svg" alt="Start a Workflow using a Temporal Client" height="901" width="1641" /></div></div>

Starting a Workflow Execution creates a new Event, WorkflowExecutionStarted, and adds it to the Workflow Execution's Event History.

The Temporal Cluster then schedules a Workflow Task by adding it to the Task Queue.
When the Worker has capacity, it picks up this Task, and begin executing code.

Each step of the Task, Scheduled, Started, Completed gets recorded into the Event History.

- Scheduled means that the Cluster has added a Task to the Task Queue.
- Started means that the Worker has dequeued the Task.
- Completed means that the Worker finished executing the Task by responding to the Cluster.

When the call to invoke the Activity is evaluated, the Worker suspends executing the code and sends a Command to the Temporal Cluster to schedule an Activity Task.

<div class="tdiw"><div class="tditw"><p class="tdit">Worker suspends code execution and sends a Command to the Cluster</p></div><div class="tdiiw"><img class="img_ev3q" src="/diagrams/how-sdk-works-3.svg" alt="Worker suspends code execution and sends a Command to the Cluster" height="661" width="1481" /></div></div>

When the Worker process can perform more work, it picks up the Activity Task and begins executing the Activity code, which includes the call to the external API.

If the Activity fails, say the API goes down, Temporal will automatically retry the Activity with one second between intervals, as the configurations have defined, an infinite amount of times until the Activity succeeds or is canceled.

In the case where the calls succeeds, and the code completes, the Worker tells the Cluster the Activity Task completed.

<div class="tdiw"><div class="tditw"><p class="tdit">The Worker reports that the Activity Execution completed</p></div><div class="tdiiw"><img class="img_ev3q" src="/diagrams/how-sdk-works-activity.svg" alt="The Worker reports that the Activity Execution completed" height="661" width="1481" /></div></div>

Included is any data that was returned from the Activity (results of the API call), which is then persisted in the Workflow Execution Event History, and is now accessible to the Workflow code.

The Cluster creates a new Workflow Task which the Worker picks up.

<div class="tdiw"><div class="tditw"><p class="tdit">The Worker picks up the new Task</p></div><div class="tdiiw"><img class="img_ev3q" src="/diagrams/how-sdk-works-1.svg" alt="The Worker picks up the new Task" height="661" width="1481" /></div></div>

This is when the SDK Worker Replays the Workflow code, uses the Event History as guidance on what to expect. If the Replay encounters an Event that doesnâ€™t match up with what is expected from the code, a [non-determinism](/references/errors#non-deterministic-error) error gets thrown.

If there is alignment, the Worker continues evaluating code.

Assuming the Activity Execution is successful, the Workflow now has the result of the Activity and the Worker is able to finish evaluating and executing the Workflow code, responding to the Cluster when complete.

The result of the Workflow can now be retrieved using a Temporal Client.

<div class="tdiw"><div class="tditw"><p class="tdit">The Temporal Client can now access the result of the Workflow</p></div><div class="tdiiw"><img class="img_ev3q" src="/diagrams/how-sdk-works-4.svg" alt="The Temporal Client can now access the result of the Workflow" height="901" width="1721" /></div></div>

And thatâ€™s how a Temporal Worker and Cluster work together.

## What are the differences in each SDK? {#sdk-comparison}

The SDKs for Temporal are constructed as follows:

- Go and PHP derive from the Go SDK.
- Java derives from the Java SDK.
- .Net, TypeScript, and Python derive from the Rust Core SDK.

The following table compares the features available in each SDK.

## Activities

An Activity is a normal function or method that executes a single, well-defined action (either short or long running), such as calling another service, transcoding a media file, or sending an email message.
Activity code can be non-deterministic.
We recommend that it be [idempotent](/activities#idempotency).

Workflow code orchestrates the execution of Activities, persisting the results.
If an Activity Function Execution fails, any future execution starts from initial state (except [Heartbeats](#heartbeats).

Activity Functions are executed by Worker Processes.
When the Activity Function returns, the Worker sends the results back to the Temporal Cluster as part of the [ActivityTaskCompleted](/references/events#activitytaskcompleted) Event.
The Event is added to the Workflow Execution's Event History.
For other Activity-related Events, see [Activity Events](/workflows#activity-events).

## Auth (SSL/mTLS)

Temporal SDKs support authenticating and authorizing client API calls to the Temporal server using SSL and mTLS.
SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and its successor TLS (Transport Layer Security) allow encrypted communication between the SDK client and the Temporal server over a network. mTLS (mutual TLS) is a variant where both client and server authenticate each other by verifying the provided certificates.
This ensures secure identification and access control for API calls made from the SDK clients.
Configuring SSL or mTLS authentication provides network encryption and protects against man-in-the-middle attacks when communicating with the Temporal server.

## Build ID based dispatch

Build ID dispatch is a feature in Temporal that allows running different versions of Workflow and Activity code on the same task queue. It works by associating a build ID (typically a version number or git commit hash) with each deployment of Worker code.
When a Workflow task is dispatched, Temporal will look at the build ID of the Workflow and send the task to a Worker with a compatible build ID. This allows seamless deployment of new code versions without Workflow tasks getting stuck.
Some key aspects of build ID dispatch:

- Workers advertise their build ID to Temporal when polling for tasks.
- Task Queues maintain sets of compatible build IDs. New IDs can be added to existing compatible sets.
- When dispatching a Workflow task, Temporal matches the Workflow's build ID to a compatible Worker build ID.
- Build IDs allow different versions of code to run side by side on the same task queue.
- Promoting a new build ID to the default set directs new Workflows to start on that code version.

So in summary, build ID dispatch provides a mechanism to deploy new Worker code without disrupting existing Workflows on a task queue. It's a key feature for zero-downtime deployments in Temporal.

## Built-in handler list Query

The built-in handler list Query in Temporal allows retrieving the list of registered Signal and Query handlers for a Workflow.

When this Query is sent to a Workflow, the response contains a JSON serialized list of the following information about each handler:

- Handler type: either Signal or Query
- Handler name
- Workflow function that handles the Signal or Query

This can be useful for debugging or introspecting which Signal or Query a Workflow currently supports.

## Built-in Temporal CLI dev server runner

This allows starting the CLI dev server from code rather than manually from the terminal.
It handles starting and stopping the server automatically around your Workflows.

## Bulk replayer

The bulk replayer enables efficient parallel replay of many Workflow histories from a JSON file or an array of Workflow history event objects for testing and debugging Workflows in Temporal.

## Cancellation

Cancellation in Temporal SDKs refers to the ability to stop the execution of a Workflow, Activity, or other operation before it completes normally.

Each SDK provides APIs and abstractions to enable robust cancellation handling in Workflows and Activities.

## Child Workflows

A Child Workflow Execution is a Workflow Execution that is spawned from within another Workflow.

Child Workflows in Temporal SDKs refer to Workflows that are started from within another Workflow.

Each SDK provides APIs and abstractions to handle the complexity behind the scenes.

## Continue as New

Continue-As-New is the mechanism by which all relevant state is passed to a new Workflow Execution with a fresh Event History.

## Dynamic Activities

- Activities can be invoked dynamically without pre-declaring them.
- Useful when Activity types are not known upfront.

## Dynamic Queries

- Queries can be defined and handled dynamically at runtime.
- Useful when query names are not known upfront.

## Dynamic Signals

- Signals can be defined and handled dynamically at runtime.
- Useful when signal names are not known upfront.

## Dynamic Workflows

- Workflows can be defined dynamically at runtime by composing activities.
- Useful for ad-hoc Workflows without pre-defined steps.

## Enhanced stack trace

Enhanced stack trace in Temporal is a feature that allows you to capture and view detailed information about the execution of a Workflow [1].
It provides a stack trace of all the threads owned by the Workflow execution, which can be useful for troubleshooting issues in production [3].
The `__stack_trace` query is a predefined query available in many SDKs that returns the stack trace [3].
You can use the `tctl Workflow stack` command to query the stack trace of a Workflow execution [5]. This feature is especially helpful for identifying errors and blocks in a Workflow definition [5].

## gRPC interceptors

gRPC interceptors serve as a powerful tool provided by gRPC, enabling developers to intercept and modify both incoming RPC requests and outgoing RPC responses. This mechanism can be instrumental in scenarios such as dynamic adjustments to target hosts or tweaking parameters like TLS configurations. However, for those utilizing the Temporal SDKs powered by the Rust core, which includes the TypeScript, Python, and .Net SDKs.

Currently, features like gRPC interceptors aren't implemented directly in the Rust core. This limitation extends to other scenarios like the rotation of client TLS certificates. Although technically feasible, the current workaround involves recreating the client to reflect changes.

## Health service

A health service in the context of Temporal is a component responsible for checking the health of the frontend service [1]. It ensures the proper functioning of the cluster by returning a list of cluster metrics [1]. The health checks for the Temporal cluster can be set up using TCP or gRPC on port 7233 [5]. The matching service is responsible for hosting user-facing Task Queues [3], while the history service persists Workflow execution state [4]. The Worker service performs background processing for replication queue and system Workflows [2].

## Heartbeats

A Heartbeat is a mechanism used in the Temporal Platform to ensure the progress and timely execution of Activities.
It involves periodic pings from the Activity Worker to the Temporal Cluster.
The Heartbeat Timeout specifies the maximum time between Activity Heartbeats.
Heartbeats can be used to store progress information or any other serializable object.
By Heartbeating within a specified interval lower than the Heartbeat Timeout, Activities can execute for a long time and fail fast.
Heartbeats help prevent Activity Timeouts and enable efficient retries.

## Interceptors

Interceptors are a mechanism for modifying inbound and outbound SDK calls.
Interceptors are commonly used to add tracing and authorization to the scheduling and execution of Workflows and Activities.
You can compare these to "middleware" in other frameworks.

The TypeScript SDK comes with an optional interceptor package that adds tracing with [OpenTelemetry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@temporalio/interceptors-opentelemetry).
See how to use it in the [interceptors-opentelemetry](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/tree/main/interceptors-opentelemetry) code sample.

The [Go SDK](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go) provides support for distributed tracing with **_Interceptors_**.
Interceptors uses Temporal headers to create a call graph of a [Workflow](/workflows#), along with its [Activities](/activities#) and [Child Workflows](/workflows#child-workflow).

There are several tracing implementations supported by the Temporal Go SDK.
For an [OpenTracing](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/contrib/opentracing) Interceptor, use `opentracing.NewInterceptor(opentracing.TracerOptions{})` to create a `TracingInterceptor`.

## Local Activities

A Local Activity is an Activity Execution that executes in the same process as the Workflow Execution that spawns it.
It offers a balance between the simplicity of a [Side Effect](#side-effects) and the robustness of a regular Activity.
Local Activities avoid network calls and are faster than regular Activities. However, they provide less isolation than regular Activities since they share the same process as the Workflow Execution.

## Queries

A Query is a synchronous operation that is used to get the state of a [Workflow Execution](/workflows#workflow-execution).
The state of a running Workflow Execution is constantly changing.
You can use Queries to expose the internal Workflow Execution state to the external world.
Queries are available for running or completed Workflows Executions only if the Worker is up and listening on the Task Queue.

## Remote codec

The remote codec refers to exposing a Payload Codec through HTTP endpoints for remote encoding and decoding.
It can be configured using a remote codec server, where each developer can control the mapping locally through the hosts file.
However, distributing encryption keys for decoding payloads poses a security risk.
The authorization header can be set on requests to the codec server.

## Replayer

A Replay is the method by which a Workflow Execution resumes making progress. During a Replay the Commands that are generated are checked against an existing Event History. Replays are necessary and often happen to give the effect that Workflow Executions are resumable, reliable, and durable.

For more information, see [Deterministic constraints](#deterministic-constraints).

If a failure occurs, the Workflow Execution picks up where the last recorded event occurred in the Event History.

## Retries

A Retry Policy is a collection of attributes that instructs the Temporal Server how to retry a failure of a Workflow Execution or an Activity Task Execution.

## SAGA

The saga pattern is a design approach for distributed systems where a task extends across machine or microservice boundaries.
For these tasks, it's crucial to ensure the complete execution of all steps, as partial execution can lead to undesirable outcomes.

Compensating actions, often referred to as compensating transactions, simulate the atomic execution of operations that are distributed across multiple databases in distributed systems. If any of these distributed operations fail, its effects are reversed using a compensating action. These compensating actions are integral to the broader saga pattern.

Temporal provides a dedicated Saga library, making it easier to handle these distributed tasks. You can register functions as compensations, and Temporal manages their execution:
[Java SDK Documentation](https://www.javadoc.io/static/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/1.0.0/io/temporal/workflow/Saga.html)

For those using other SDKs, you can implement functions like `addCompensation` and `compensate` to achieve similar behavior.

## Sandbox

Some SDKs support running Workflows inside a sandbox environment.

The Temporal Python SDK, for example, enables you to run Workflow code in a sandbox environment to help prevent non-determinism errors in your application.
The Temporal Workflow Sandbox for Python is not completely isolated, and some libraries can internally mutate state, which can result in breaking determinism.

<!-- V8 Isolates TypeScript -->

By default, Workflows run in a sandbox environment. If a Workflow Execution performs a non-deterministic event, an exception is thrown, which results in failing the Workflow Task. The Workflow will not progress until the code is fixed.

## Schedules

A Schedule contains instructions for starting a [Workflow Execution](/workflows#workflow-execution) at specific times.
Schedules provide a more flexible and user-friendly approach than [Temporal Cron Jobs](/workflows#temporal-cron-job).

## SDK Metrics

SDK Metrics track various aspects of worker performance, such as task queue, namespace, poller type, worker type, activity type, workflow type, and operation.

For more information on metrics see, [Temporal SDK metrics reference](/references/sdk-metrics#).

## Search Attributes

A Search Attribute is an indexed field used in a [List Filter](/visibility#list-filter) to filter a list of [Workflow Executions](/workflows#workflow-execution) that have the Search Attribute in their metadata.

## Sessions

The Go SDK provides a support for [Worker Session](dev-guide/go/features#enable-sessions). This makes task routing seamless by ensuring that Activity Tasks are dispatched to the same Worker without having to handle the intricacies of Task Queue naming.
This abstraction simplifies scenarios where consistency or state is pivotal.

While Go provides built-in support, other SDKs like TypeScript and Python don't have a native concept of Sessions.
Instead, they embrace a design pattern known as [Worker-Specific Task Queues](#worker-specific-task-queues) to achieve similar consistency guarantees.
Under this model, all computational tasks of a Workflow are designed to execute on a single Worker.
Although this might seem like a manual replica of the Session feature in Go, it is often the preferred way to ensure tasks are performed in a consistent environment.

For instance, in scenarios where there's a need to interact with file systemsâ€”like data processing tasks or engagements with legacy structuresâ€”a sticky execution ensures that all tasks are performed in the same file context.
In the provided example, text files are written to Worker-specific folders.
While this serves as a demonstration, real-world applications might involve dedicated machines in a Worker cluster, each corresponding to a 'sticky' Worker, or Worker-Specific Task Queue.

## Side Effects

A **Side Effect** is a unique operation that, once executed, does not re-execute upon replay. Instead, it returns the recorded result from its initial execution. This characteristic is crucial when designing Workflows to ensure determinism.

:::note ðŸ’¡

Never implement a Side Effect that has a possibility of failing. If a Side Effect fails, there's a risk it could execute more than once, leading to non-deterministic behavior.

:::

If there's any potential that the code you're considering for a Side Effect might fail or encounter errors, opt for an **Activity** instead.

For SDKs that do not support Side Effects, or if you're looking for a lightweight alternative, consider using a [Local Activity](/activities#local-activity).

## Signal/Cancel External Workflow

Signal/Cancel External Workflow refers to the process of externally requesting the cancellation of a Workflow.
Cancellation is an external request to a Workflow from outside, typically through the Client.
In Temporal, canceling a workflow itself doesn't make sense as cancellation is an external action.
Instead of using self-cancellation, you should request cancellation through the Client.
Temporal Workflows can wait for external signals or events before proceeding with execution.
External Signals can be used to trigger the rerun of a Workflow after a specified period, including the time spent waiting for the Signal.

## Signals

A Signal is an asynchronous request to a [Workflow Execution](/workflows#workflow-execution).

## Static analyzer

The [Temporal Workflow Check](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/tree/master/contrib/tools/workflowcheck) is a tool that statically analyzes Temporal Workflow Definitions written in Go (i.e. functions with `workflow.Context`` as first argument) to check for non-deterministic code either directly in the function or in a function called by the Workflow.
It is highly optimized to scan large codebases quickly.

:::note
This will not catch all cases of non-determinism such as global var mutation. This is just a helper and developers should still scrutinize Workflow code for other non-determinisms.
:::

TypeScript has support for a [VS Code extension](#vscode-extension-support).

## Timers

A Workflow can set a durable timer for a fixed time period.
In some SDKs, the function is called `sleep()`, and in others, it's called `timer()`.

SDKs that use timer:

- Go (`NewTimer`)
- PHP
- Python

SDKs that use sleep:

- Go
- Java
- TypeScript

SDKs that use `Workflow.DelayAsync`:

- .Net

## Type safety

Type safety refers to the ability to catch type errors at compile time.

## Unit testing

In the context of Temporal, you can create these types of automated tests:

- **End-to-end**: Running a Temporal Server and Worker with all its Workflows and Activities; starting and interacting with Workflows from a Client.
- **Integration**: Anything between end-to-end and unit testing.
  - Running Activities with mocked Context and other SDK imports (and usually network requests).
  - Running Workers with mock Activities, and using a Client to start Workflows.
  - Running Workflows with mocked SDK imports.
- **Unit**: Running a piece of Workflow or Activity code (a function or method) and mocking any code it calls.

## Upsert memo

A Memo is a non-indexed set of Workflow Execution metadata that developers supply at start time or in Workflow code and that is returned when you describe or list Workflow Executions.
Upsert Memo allows you to update the Memo field for a running Workflow Execution, similar to upserting a Search Attribute.
This is useful if you want to record additional metadata about the execution as it runs.

## Versioning / Patching

Worker Versioning simplifies the process of deploying changes to [Workflow Definitions](/workflows/#workflow-definition).
It does this by letting you define sets of versions that are compatible with each other, and then assigning a Build ID to the code that defines a Worker.
The Temporal Server uses the Build ID to determine which versions of a Workflow Definition a Worker can process.

## VSCode extension support

If you're using VS Code, you can use the [Temporal VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=temporal-technologies.temporalio) to easily load Event Histories and set breakpoints on Events.
For usage, see the [announcement post](https://temporal.io/blog/temporal-for-vs-code) or [demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IjQde9HMNY).

## Worker-Specific Task Queues

A Worker-Specific Task Queue, also known as Sticky Execution, is when a Worker Entity caches the Workflow in memory and creates a dedicated Task Queue to listen on.

A Worker-Specific Task Queue occurs after a Worker Entity completes the first Workflow Task in the chain of Workflow Tasks for the Workflow Execution.

The Worker Entity caches the Workflow in memory and begins polling the dedicated Task Queue for Workflow Tasks that contain updates, rather than the entire Event History.

If the Worker Entity does not pick up a Workflow Task from the dedicated Task Queue in an appropriate amount of time, the Cluster will resume Scheduling Workflow Tasks on the original Task Queue.
Another Worker Entity can then resume the Workflow Execution, and can set up its own Worker-Specific Task Queue for future Workflow Tasks.

- [How to set a `StickyScheduleToStartTimeout` on a Worker Entity in Go](/dev-guide/go/foundations#stickyscheduletostarttimeout)

Worker-Specific Task Queues are the default behavior of the Temporal Platform.

## Workflow Update

An Workflow Update is a request to and a response from a Temporal Client to a Workflow Execution.

The Workflow must have a function to handle the Update. Unlike a Signal handler, the Update handler function can mutate the state of the Workflow while also returning a value to the caller.
The Update handler listens for Updates by the Update's name.

When there is the potential for multiple Updates to cause a duplication problem, Temporal recommends adding idempotency logic to your Update handler that checks for duplicates.

For more information, see [What is an Update?](/workflows#update).
