Send logs and errors to a logging service, so that when things go wrong, you can see what happened.

The SDK core uses `WARN` for its default logging level.

In Workflow Definitions you can use [`workflow.GetLogger(ctx)`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow#GetLogger) to write logs.

```go
import (
	"context"
	"time"

	"go.temporal.io/sdk/activity"
	"go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow"
)

// Workflow is a standard workflow definition.
// Note that the Workflow and Activity don't need to care that
// their inputs/results are being compressed.
func Workflow(ctx workflow.Context, name string) (string, error) {
// ...

workflow.WithActivityOptions(ctx, ao)

// Getting the logger from the context.
	logger := workflow.GetLogger(ctx)
// Logging a message with the key value pair `name` and `name`
	logger.Info("Compressed Payloads workflow started", "name", name)

	info := map[string]string{
		"name": name,
	}


	logger.Info("Compressed Payloads workflow completed.", "result", result)

	return result, nil
}
```

### How to provide a custom logger {#custom-logger}

Use a custom logger for logging.

This field sets a custom Logger that is used for all logging actions of the instance of the Temporal Client.

Although the Go SDK does not support most third-party logging solutions natively, [our friends at Banzai Cloud](https://github.com/sagikazarmark) built the adapter package [logur](https://github.com/logur/logur) which makes it possible to use third party loggers with minimal overhead.
Most of the popular logging solutions have existing adapters in Logur, but you can find a full list [in the Logur Github project](https://github.com/logur?q=adapter-).

Here is an example of using Logur to support [Logrus](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus):

```go
package main
import (
  "go.temporal.io/sdk/client"

	"github.com/sirupsen/logrus"
	logrusadapter "logur.dev/adapter/logrus"
	"logur.dev/logur"
)

func main() {
  // ...
  logger := logur.LoggerToKV(logrusadapter.New(logrus.New()))
  clientOptions := client.Options{
    Logger: logger,
  }
  temporalClient, err := client.Dial(clientOptions)
  // ...
}
```
