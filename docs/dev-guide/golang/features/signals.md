A [Signal](/workflows#signal) is a message sent to a running Workflow Execution.

Signals are defined in your code and handled in your Workflow Definition.
Signals can be sent to Workflow Executions from a Temporal Client or from another Workflow Execution.

## How to define a Signal in Go {#define-signal}

A Signal has a name and can have arguments.

- The name, also called a Signal type, is a string.
- The arguments must be [serializable](/dataconversion#).

```go
signalName := "alertWorkflow
```

Structs should be used to define Signals and carry data, as long as the struct is [serializable via the Data Converter](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/converter#CompositeDataConverter.ToPayload).
The `Receive()` method on the Data Converter decodes the data into the Struct within the Workflow.
Only public fields are serializable.

```go
MySignal struct {
	Message string // serializable
	message string // not serializable
}
```

## How to handle a Signal {#handle-signal}

Workflows listen for Signals by the Signal's name.

Use the `GetSignalChannel()` API from the `go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow` package to get the Signal Channel.

```go
func YourWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context, param YourWorkflowParam) error {
  // ...
  var signal MySignal
  signalChan := workflow.GetSignalChannel(ctx, "your-signal-name")
  signalChan.Receive(ctx, &signal)
  if len(signal.Message) > 0 && signal.Message != "SOME_VALUE" {
      return errors.New("signal")
  }
  // ...
}
```

In the example above, the Workflow code uses `workflow.GetSignalChannel` to open a `workflow.Channel` for the Signal type (identified by the Signal name).

Before completing the Workflow or using [Continue-As-New](/dev-guide/go/features/continue-as-new#continue-as-new), make sure to do an asynchronous drain on the Signal channel.
Otherwise, the Signals will be lost.

## How to send a Signal from a Temporal Client {#send-signal-from-client}

When a Signal is sent successfully from the Temporal Client, the [WorkflowExecutionSignaled](/references/events#workflowexecutionsignaled) Event appears in the Event History of the Workflow that receives the Signal.

Use the `SignalWorkflow()` method on an instance of the [Go SDK Temporal Client](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/client#Client) to send a [Signal](/workflows#signal) to a [Workflow Execution](/workflows#workflow-execution).

Pass in both the [Workflow Id](/workflows#workflow-id) and [Run Id](/workflows#run-id) to uniquely identify the Workflow Execution.
If only the Workflow Id is supplied (provide an empty string as the Run Id param), the Workflow Execution that is Running receives the Signal.

```go
// ...
signal := MySignal {
  Message: "Some important data",
}
err = temporalClient.SignalWorkflow(context.Background(), "your-workflow-id", runID, "your-signal-name", signal)
if err != nil {
	log.Fatalln("Error sending the Signal", err)
	return
}
// ...
```

Possible errors:

- `serviceerror.NotFound`
- `serviceerror.Internal`
- `serviceerror.Unavailable`

## How to send a Signal from a Workflow {#send-signal-from-workflow}

A Workflow can send a Signal to another Workflow, in which case it's called an _External Signal_.

When an External Signal is sent:

- A [SignalExternalWorkflowExecutionInitiated](/references/events#signalexternalworkflowexecutioninitiated) Event appears in the sender's Event History.
- A [WorkflowExecutionSignaled](/references/events#workflowexecutionsignaled) Event appears in the recipient's Event History.

A Signal can be sent from within a Workflow to a different Workflow Execution using the [`SignalExternalWorkflow`](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow#SignalExternalWorkflow) API from the `go.temporal.io/sdk/workflow` package.

```go
// ...
func YourWorkflowDefinition(ctx workflow.Context, param YourWorkflowParam) error {
  //...
  signal := MySignal {
    Message: "Some important data",
  }
  err :=  workflow.SignalExternalWorkflow(ctx, "some-workflow-id", "", "your-signal-name", signal).Get(ctx, nil)
  if err != nil {
    // ...
  }
// ...
}
```

## How to Signal-With-Start {#signal-with-start}

Signal-With-Start is used from the Client.
It takes a Workflow Id, Workflow arguments, a Signal name, and Signal arguments.

If there's a Workflow running with the given Workflow Id, it will be signaled. If there isn't, a new Workflow will be started and immediately signaled.

Use the `SignalWithStartWorkflow()` API on the Go SDK Temporal Client to start a Workflow Execution (if not already running) and pass it the Signal at the same time.

Because the Workflow Execution might not exist, this API does not take a Run ID as a parameter

```go
// ...
signal := MySignal {
  Message: "Some important data",
}
err = temporalClient.SignalWithStartWorkflow(context.Background(), "your-workflow-id", "your-signal-name", signal)
if err != nil {
	log.Fatalln("Error sending the Signal", err)
	return
}
```
