The Foundations section of the Temporal Developer's guide covers the minimum set of concepts and implementation details needed to build and run a [Temporal Application](/temporal#temporal-application)—that is, all the relevant steps to start a [Workflow Execution](#develop-workflows) that executes an [Activity](#develop-activities).

In this section you can find the following:

- [Run a development Cluster](/dev-guide/typescript/foundations#run-a-development-server)
- [Connect to a dev Cluster](#connect-to-a-dev-cluster)
- [Connect to Temporal Cloud](#connect-to-temporal-cloud)
- [Develop a Workflow](#develop-workflows)
- [Develop an Activity](#develop-activities)
- [Start an Activity Execution](#activity-execution)
- [Run a dev Worker](#run-a-dev-worker)
- [Run a Temporal Cloud Worker](#run-a-dev-worker)
- [Start a Workflow Execution](#start-workflow-execution)

## How to install the Temporal CLI and run a development server {#run-a-development-server}

This section describes how to install the [Temporal CLI](/cli) and run a development Cluster.
The local development Cluster comes packaged with the [Temporal Web UI](/web-ui).

For information on deploying and running a self-hosted production Cluster, see the [Self-hosted guide](/self-hosted-guide), or sign up for [Temporal Cloud](/cloud) and let us run your production Cluster for you.

Temporal CLI is a tool for interacting with a Temporal Cluster from the command line and it includes a distribution of the Temporal Server and Web UI.
This local development Cluster runs as a single process with zero runtime dependencies and it supports persistence to disk and in-memory mode through SQLite.

**Install the Temporal CLI**

Choose one of the following install methods to install the Temporal CLI.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="macOS" label="macOS">

- Install the Temporal CLI with Homebrew.

  ```bash
  brew install temporal
  ```

- Install the Temporal CLI with cURL.

  ```bash
  curl -sSf https://temporal.download/cli.sh | sh
  ```

- Install the Temporal CLI from CDN.
  1. Select the platform and architecture needed.
     - <a href="https://temporal.download/cli/archive/latest?platform=darwin&arch=amd64">Download for Darwin amd64</a>
     - <a href="https://temporal.download/cli/archive/latest?platform=darwin&arch=arm64">Download for Darwin arm64</a>
  2. Extract the downloaded archive.
  3. Add the `temporal` binary to your PATH.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Linux" label="Linux">

- Install the Temporal CLI with cURL.

  ```bash
  curl -sSf https://temporal.download/cli.sh | sh
  ```

- Install the Temporal CLI from CDN.
  1. Select the platform and architecture needed.
     - <a href="https://temporal.download/cli/archive/latest?platform=linux&arch=amd64">Download for Linux amd64</a>
     - <a href="https://temporal.download/cli/archive/latest?platform=linux&arch=arm64">Download for Linux arm64</a>
  2. Extract the downloaded archive.
  3. Add the `temporal` binary to your PATH.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Windows" label="Windows">

- Install the Temporal CLI from CDN.
  1. Select the platform and architecture needed and download the binary.
     - <a href="https://temporal.download/cli/archive/latest?platform=windows&arch=amd64">Download for Windows amd64</a>
     - <a href="https://temporal.download/cli/archive/latest?platform=windows&arch=arm64">Download for Windows arm64</a>
  2. Extract the downloaded archive.
  3. Add the `temporal.exe` binary to your PATH.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

**Start the Temporal Development Server**

Start the Temporal Development Server by using the `server start-dev` command.

```bash
temporal server start-dev
```

This command automatically starts the Web UI, creates the default [Namespace](/namespaces), and uses an in-memory database.

The Temporal Server should be available on `localhost:7233` and the Temporal Web UI should be accessible at [`http://localhost:8233`](http://localhost:8233/).

The server's startup configuration can be customized using command line options.
For a full list of options, run:

```bash
temporal server start-dev --help
```

## How to install a Temporal SDK {#install-a-temporal-sdk}

A [Temporal SDK](/encyclopedia/temporal-sdks) provides a framework for [Temporal Application](/temporal#temporal-application) development.

An SDK provides you with the following:

- A [Temporal Client](/encyclopedia/temporal-sdks#temporal-client) to communicate with a [Temporal Cluster](/clusters).
- APIs to develop [Workflows](/workflows).
- APIs to create and manage [Worker Processes](/workers#worker).
- APIs to author [Activities](/activities#activity-definition).

[![Python 3.7+](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/temporalio.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://pypi.org/project/temporalio)
[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/temporalio.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://pypi.org/project/temporalio)

To install the latest version of the Temporal Python package, run the following command.

```bash
pip install temporalio
```

### How to find the Python SDK API reference {#api-reference}

The Temporal Python SDK API reference is published on [python.temporal.io](https://python.temporal.io/index.html).

### Where are SDK-specific code examples? {#code-samples}

You can find a complete list of executable code samples in [Temporal's GitHub repository](https://github.com/temporalio?q=samples-&type=all&language=&sort=).

Additionally, several of the [Tutorials](https://learn.temporal.io) are backed by a fully executable template application.
