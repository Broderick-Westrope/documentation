This guide is meant to provide a comprehensive overview of the structures, primitives, and features used in [Temporal Application](/temporal#temporal-application) development.

## Core application

Develop basic Temporal application with workflows & activities in Python using Temporal SDK.

- [Develop a basic Workflow](devguide/python/coreapplication#develop-a-basic-workflow)
- [Develop a basic Activity](devguide/python/coreapplication#develop-a-basic-activity)
- [Start an Activity Execution](devguide/python/coreapplication#start-a-nactivity-execution)
- [Run a Worker Processes](/dev-guide/python/core-application#run-a-worker-processes)


## Temporal Client

Master the Temporal Python Client with our comprehensive guide that covers everything from initialization to Workflow Execution.

- [Connect to development Temporal Service](/dev-guide/python/temporal-clients#connect-to-development-temporal-service)
- [Connect to Temporal Cloud](/dev-guide/python/temporal-clients#connect-to-temporal-cloud)
- [Start a Workflow Execution](/dev-guide/python/temporal-clients#start-a-workflow-execution)


## Test suites

The Testing section of the Temporal Developer's guide covers the many ways to test the state of your Temporal Application; that is, ways to view which Workflow Executions are tracked by the Platform and the state of any given Workflow Execution, either currently or at points of an execution.

- [Test frameworks](devguide/python/testsuites#test-frameworks)
- [Testing Activities](devguide/python/testsuites#testing-activities)
- [Testing Workflows](devguide/python/testsuites#testing-workflows)
- [How to Replay a Workflow Execution](/dev-guide/python/test-suites#how-to-replay-a-workflowexecution)


## Failure detection

- [Workflow timeouts](devguide/python/failuredetection#workflow-timeouts)
- [Set Activity timeouts](devguide/python/failuredetection#set-activity-timeouts)
- [Heartbeat an Activity](devguide/python/failuredetection#heartbeat-an-activity)



## Messages

Explore using Signals in Temporal Python to send messages to Workflows, with details on defining, sending, and handling Signals, including customization options.

- [Develop with Signals](/dev-guide/python/messages#develop-with-signals)
- [Develop with Queries](/dev-guide/python/messages#develop-with-queries)
- [Develop with Updates](/dev-guide/python/messages#develop-with-updates)
- [What is a Dynamic Handler](/dev-guide/python/messages#what-is-a-dynamic-handler)




## Cancellation

Cancel an Activity from a Workflow, sending Heartbeats and setting a Heartbeat Timeout, and handling cancellation errors.

- [Cancel an Activity from a Workflow](//dev-guide/python/cancellation)



## Asynchronous Activity Completion

Complete an Activity without waiting for execution to finish, using Temporal Client and Activity Function.

- [Asynchronously complete an Activity](/dev-guide/python/asynchronous-activity-completion#asynchronously-complete-an-activity)



## Versioning

The Versioning section of the Temporal Developer's guide covers how to update Workflow Definitions without causing non-deterministic behavior in current long-running Workflows.

- [Introduction to Versioning](/dev-guide/python/versioning#introduction-to-versioning)
- [How to use the Patching API](/dev-guide/python/versioning#how-to-use-the-patching-api)
- [How to use Worker Versioning](/dev-guide/python/versioning#how-touse-worker-versioning)



## Observability

Learn about observability tools for Temporal applications, covering metrics, tracing, logging, and visibility to monitor and troubleshoot Workflows.

- [Emit metrics](/dev-guide/python/observability#metrics)
- [Setup Tracing](/dev-guide/python/observability#tracing)
- [Log from a Workflow](/dev-guide/python/observability#logging)
- [Use Visibility APIs](/dev-guide/python/observability#visibility)

## Debugging

The Debugging section of the Temporal Developer's guide covers the many ways to debug your application.

- [Debugging](/dev-guide/python/debugging#debugging)


## Schedules

Discover how to effectively Schedule Workflows in Temporal Python, covering creation, management, and operations like backfilling, deleting, and triggering Scheduled Workflows for precise automation timing.

- [Schedule a Workflow](/dev-guide/python/schedules#schedule-a-workflow)
- [Temporal Cron Jobs](/dev-guide/python/schedules#temporal-cron-jobs)
- [Start Delay](/dev-guide/python/schedules#start-delay)



## Data encryption

The Converters and Codecs section of the Temporal Developer's guide provides guidance on how to support compression, encryption, and other special data handling by implementing custom converters and codecs.

- [Custom Payload Codec](/dev-guide/python/data-encryption#custom-payload-codec)
- [Payload conversion](/dev-guide/python/data-encryption#payload-conversion)


## Child Workflows

Spawn a new Workflow from within another Workflow, with options for Parent Close Policy and handling Child Workflow Events.

- [Start a Child Workflow Execution](devguide/python/child-workflows)



## Continue-As-New

Close a Workflow Execution and create a new one with the same Workflow ID, new Run ID, and fresh Event History.

- [Continue-As-New](/dev-guide/python/continueasnew#continue-as-new)


## Timers

Learn how to use timers within Temporal Workflows to delay execution, enabling durable and long-term scheduling of tasks that can persist even if the worker or cluster goes down.

- [What is a Timer](/dev-guide/python/timers#what-is-a-timer)



## Interrupt a Workflow Execution

Learn how to interrupt a workflow execution by canceling or terminating, including the differences and use cases for each method.

- [Interrupt a Workflow Execution](/dev-guide/python/interrupt-workflow#interrupt-a-workflow-execution})
