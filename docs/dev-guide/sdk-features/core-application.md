All SDKs support the fundamental ability to define functions or object methods as either Workflows or Activities, and register that functionality with a Worker.

## Workflows {#workflows}

Often referred to as a Workflow Definition, and considered to be the fundamental unit of a Temporal Application, this code orchestrates the execution of Activities, persisting the results.
Workflow code effectively executes once to completion.
This is also called Durable Execution.

When developing Workflow Definitions, it's crucial to ensure they consistently demonstrate deterministic characteristics.
Specifically, they should emit the same Commands in the same order each time the Workflow code executes within the context of an existing Workflow Execution.

Workflow Execution involves the re-execution of the Workflow code, known as Replay.
The Workflow Definitions's use of Workflow APIs generates Commands, which instruct the Cluster on which Events to create and add to the Workflow Execution's Event History.
During the Workflow code's execution, the emitted Commands get compared to the existing Event History.
Progression in the Workflow Execution occurs if there's an Event in the Event History that corresponds to the Command's generation in the same sequence and certain specific metadata of the Command aligns with that of the Event.

## Activities {#activities}

Often referred to as an Activity Definition, this code is a function or method that defines a single, well-defined action (either short or long running), such as calling another service, transcoding a media file, or sending an email message.

Activity code can be non-deterministic.
However, We recommend that Activities be [idempotent](/activities#idempotency).

Workflow code orchestrates the execution of Activities, persisting the results.
If an Activity Function Execution fails, any future execution starts from initial state (Exception when [Heartbeatig](/dev-guide/sdk-features/activity-heartbeats#)).

## Workers {#workers}

A Temporal Worker is essentially a horizontally scalable executable Temporal Application (bundled Workflow and Activity code).
Run as many Workers (instances of your application) as needed.
