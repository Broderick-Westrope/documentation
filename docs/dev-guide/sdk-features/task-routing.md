You can run as many Workers as you need to.
However, somtimes you want a specific Worker to handle specifc Tasks.
This is called Task Routing.

In all SDKs you can do this through the registration and identification of Tasks Queues.

The Go SDK, in addition to standard Task Routing, also offers a similar experience through a Sessions API.
