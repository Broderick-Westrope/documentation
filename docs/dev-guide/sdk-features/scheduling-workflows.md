**What is a Schedule?**

A Schedule has instructions for starting a [Workflow Execution](/workflows#workflow-execution) at specific times.
Schedules offer a more flexible and user-friendly approach than [Temporal Cron Jobs](/workflows#temporal-cron-job).

- TypeScript SDK

</LanguageLinks>

A Schedule has an identity and is independent of a Workflow Execution.
This differs from a Temporal Cron Job, which relies on a cron schedule as a property of the Workflow Execution.

:::info

For triggering a Workflow Execution at a specific one-time future point rather than on a recurring schedule, the [Start Delay](/workflows#delay-workflow-execution) option should be used instead of a Schedule.

:::

### Action

The Action of a Schedule is where the Workflow Execution properties are established, such as Workflow Type, Task Queue, parameters, and timeouts.

Workflow Executions started by a Schedule have the following additional properties:

- The Action's timestamp is appended to the Workflow Id.
- The `TemporalScheduledStartTime` [Search Attribute](/visibility#search-attribute) is added to the Workflow Execution.
  The value is the Action's timestamp.
- The `TemporalScheduledById` Search Attribute is added to the Workflow Execution.
  The value is the Schedule Id.

### Spec

The Schedule Spec describes when the Action is taken.
There are two kinds of Schedule Spec:

- A simple interval, like "every 30 minutes" (aligned to start at the Unix epoch, and optionally including a phase offset).
- A calendar-based expression, similar to the "cron expressions" supported by lots of software, including the older Temporal Cron feature.

These two kinds have multiple representations, depending on the interface or SDK you're using, but they all support the same features.

In tctl, for example, an interval is specified as a string like `45m` to mean every 45 minutes, or `6h/5h` to mean every 6 hours but at the start of the fifth hour within each period.

In tctl, a calendar expression can be specified as either a traditional cron string with five (or six or seven) positional fields, or as JSON with named fields:

```json
{
  "year": "2022",
  "month": "Jan,Apr,Jul,Oct",
  "dayOfMonth": "1,15",
  "hour": "11-14"
}
```

The following calendar JSON fields are available:

- `year`
- `month`
- `dayOfMonth`
- `dayOfWeek`
- `hour`
- `minute`
- `second`
- `comment`

Each field can contain a comma-separated list of ranges (or the `*` wildcard), and each range can include a slash followed by a skip value.
The `hour`, `minute`, and `second` fields default to `0` while the others default to `*`, so you can describe many useful specs with only a few fields.

For `month`, names of months may be used instead of integers (case-insensitive, abbreviations permitted).
For `dayOfWeek`, day-of-week names may be used.

The `comment` field is optional and can be used to include a free-form description of the intent of the calendar spec, useful for complicated specs.

No matter which form you supply, calendar and interval specs are converted to canonical representations.
What you see when you "describe" or "list" a Schedule might not look exactly like what you entered, but it has the same meaning.

Other Spec features:

**Multiple intervals/calendar expressions:** A Spec can have combinations of multiple intervals and/or calendar expressions to define a specific Schedule.

**Time bounds:** Provide an absolute start or end time (or both) with a Spec to ensure that no actions are taken before the start time or after the end time.

**Exclusions:** A Spec can contain exclusions in the form of zero or more calendar expressions.
This can be used to express scheduling like "each Monday at noon except for holidays.
You'll have to provide your own set of exclusions and include it in each schedule; there are no pre-defined sets.
(This feature isn't currently exposed in tctl or the Temporal Web UI.)

**Jitter:** If given, a random offset between zero and the maximum jitter is added to each Action time (but bounded by the time until the next scheduled Action).

**Time zones:** By default, calendar-based expressions are interpreted in UTC.
Temporal recommends using UTC to avoid various surprising properties of time zones.
If you don't want to use UTC, you can provide the name of a time zone.
The time zone definition is loaded on the Temporal Server Worker Service from either disk or the fallback embedded in the binary.

For more operational control, embed the contents of the time zone database file in the Schedule Spec itself.
(Note: this isn't currently exposed in tctl or the web UI.)

### Pause

A Schedule can be Paused.
When a Schedule is Paused, the Spec has no effect.
However, you can still force manual actions by using the [tctl schedule trigger](/tctl-v1/schedule#trigger) command.

To assist communication among developers and operators, a “notes” field can be updated on pause or resume to store an explanation for the current state.

### Backfill

A Schedule can be Backfilled.
When a Schedule is Backfilled, all the Actions that would have been taken over a specified time period are taken now (in parallel if the `AllowAll` [Overlap Policy](#overlap-policy) is used; sequentially if `BufferAll` is used).
You might use this to fill in runs from a time period when the Schedule was paused due to an external condition that's now resolved, or a period before the Schedule was created.

### Limit number of Actions

A Schedule can be limited to a certain number of scheduled Actions (that is, not trigger immediately).
After that it will act as if it were paused.

### Policies

A Schedule supports a set of Policies that enable customizing behavior.

#### Overlap Policy

The Overlap Policy controls what happens when it is time to start a Workflow Execution but a previously started Workflow Execution is still running.
The following options are available:

- `Skip`: **Default**.
  Nothing happens; the Workflow Execution is not started.
- `BufferOne`: Starts the Workflow Execution as soon as the current one completes.
  The buffer is limited to one.
  If another Workflow Execution is supposed to start, but one is already in the buffer, only the one in the buffer eventually starts.
- `BufferAll`: Allows an unlimited number of Workflows to buffer.
  They are started sequentially.
- `CancelOther`: Cancels the running Workflow Execution, and then starts the new one after the old one completes cancellation.
- `TerminateOther`: Terminates the running Workflow Execution and starts the new one immediately.
- `AllowAll` Starts any number of concurrent Workflow Executions.
  With this policy (and only this policy), more than one Workflow Execution, started by the Schedule, can run simultaneously.

#### Catchup Window

The Temporal Cluster might be down or unavailable at the time when a Schedule should take an Action.
When it comes back up, the Catchup Window controls which missed Actions should be taken at that point.
The default is one year, meaning Actions will be taken unless over one year late.
If your Actions are more time-sensitive, you can set the Catchup Window to a smaller value (minimum ten seconds), accepting that an outage longer than the window could lead to missed Actions.
(But you can always [Backfill](#backfill).)

#### Pause-on-failure

If this policy is set, a Workflow Execution started by a Schedule that ends with a failure or timeout (but not Cancellation or Termination) causes the Schedule to automatically pause.

Note that with the `AllowAll` Overlap Policy, this pause might not apply to the next Workflow Execution, because the next Workflow Execution might have started before the failed one finished.
It applies only to Workflow Executions that were scheduled to start after the failed one finished.

### Last completion result

A Workflow started by a Schedule can obtain the completion result from the most recent successful run.
(How you do this depends on the SDK you're using.)

For overlap policies that don't allow overlap, “the most recent successful run” is straightforward to define.
For the `AllowAll` policy, it refers to the run that completed most recently, at the time that the run in question is started.
Consider the following overlapping runs:

```
time -------------------------------------------->
 A     |----------------------|
 B               |-------|
 C                          |---------------|
 D                                |--------------T
```

If D asks for the last completion result at time T, it gets the result of A.
Not B, even though B started more recently, because A completed later.
And not C, even though C completed after A, because the result for D is captured when D is started, not when it's queried.

Failures and timeouts do not affect the last completion result.

:::note

When a Schedule triggers a Workflow that completes successfully and yields a result, the result from the initial Schedule execution can be accessed by the subsequent scheduled execution through `LastCompletionResult`.

Be aware that if, during the subsequent run, the Workflow employs the [Continue-As-New](/workflows#continue-as-new) feature, `LastCompletionResult` won't be accessible for this new Workflow iteration.

It is important to note that the [status](/workflows#status) of the subsequent run is marked as `Continued-As-New` and not as `Completed`.

:::

### Last failure

A Workflow started by a Schedule can obtain the details of the failure of the most recent run that ended at the time when the Workflow in question was started. Unlike last completion result, a _successful_ run _does_ reset the last failure.

## Start Delay {#start-delay}

:::tip Support, stability, and dependency info

- Introduced in the [Temporal Go SDK 1.25.0](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/releases/tag/v1.25.0)
- Introduced in the [Temporal Java SDK 1.25.0](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/releases/tag/v1.22.1)
- Introduced in the [Temporal Python SDK 1.4.0](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/releases/tag/1.4.0)

:::

Start Delay is a feature that sets a delay period before initiating a Workflow Execution.

:::info Experimental feature

Note that Start Delay is currently incompatible with [Schedules](#schedules) and [Cron Jobs](#cron-jobs).
As an experimental feature, it may undergo changes in future releases.

:::

This option is particularly useful for scheduling a single-execution Workflow in the future, as opposed to using Schedules for recurring Workflows.

During the delay period, if the Workflow receives a Signal-With-Start, it immediately dispatches a Workflow Task, bypassing the remaining delay.

Conversely, if the Workflow receives any other type of Signal during this period, it is ignored, and the Workflow remains delayed until either the delay expires or a Signal-With-Start is received.

To implement this delay, set the Start Delay option in the Workflow Options field within the SDK of your choice.

## Cron Jobs {#cron-jobs}

:::info

We recommend using [Schedules](/workflows#schedule) instead of Cron Jobs.
Schedules were built to provide a better developer experience, including more configuration options and the ability to update or pause running Schedules.

:::

**What is a Temporal Cron Job?**

A Temporal Cron Job consists of a sequence of Workflow Executions triggered according to a Cron Schedule specified when initiating a Workflow Execution. This mechanism is analogous to a traditional Unix cron job.

<LanguageLinks>

- Python SDK

- TypeScript SDK
- [Feature guide](/dev-guide/typescript/features#temporal-cron-jobs)
</LanguageLinks>

Just like a Unix cron job, which requires a command and a schedule to execute that command, a Cron Schedule is specified when initiating a Workflow Execution in Temporal.
If you provide a Cron Schedule, the Temporal Server will regularly trigger executions for the specified Workflow Type, following the schedule.

<div class="tdiw"><div class="tditw"><p class="tdit">Temporal Cron Job timeline</p></div><div class="tdiiw"><img class="img_ev3q" src="/diagrams/temporal-cron-job.svg" alt="Temporal Cron Job timeline" height="1113" width="1782" /></div></div>

Each execution in this series is known as a Run.
Here are some key characteristics of these Runs:

- Each Run receives the same input parameters as the initial Run.
- Each Run inherits the Workflow Options set for the initial Run.

The Temporal Cluster initiates the first Workflow Execution in the sequence immediately.
However, it introduces a backoff period, ensuring that the first Workflow Task enters the Task Queue at the scheduled time.
Upon the completion, failure, or expiration (reaching the Workflow Run Timeout) of a Run, the process repeats: the next Run is created instantly, with a new backoff based on the current time and the Cron Schedule.

The next Run is only initiated after the current Run completes, fails, or times out.
If a Retry Policy is in place and a Run fails or times out, the Run will undergo retries according to this policy until it completes or the policy is exhausted.
If the schedule calls for a new Run while the current Run is still active (including during retries), the Server will start the new Run only after the current one completes successfully.
The start time of this new Run, along with the Cron definitions, determines the "first Workflow Task backoff" for the Run.

A Workflow Execution Timeout limits the total active duration of a Workflow, inclusive of retries and any 'Continue As New' actions.
The Cron Schedule-based executions will continue until this Workflow Execution Timeout is reached or the Workflow is manually terminated.

### Cron Schedules

Cron Schedules are interpreted in UTC time by default.

The Cron Schedule is provided as a string and must follow one of two specifications:

**Classic specification**

This is what the "classic" specification looks like:

```
┌───────────── minute (0 - 59)
│ ┌───────────── hour (0 - 23)
│ │ ┌───────────── day of the month (1 - 31)
│ │ │ ┌───────────── month (1 - 12)
│ │ │ │ ┌───────────── day of the week (0 - 6) (Sunday to Saturday)
│ │ │ │ │
│ │ │ │ │
* * * * *
```

For example, `15 8 * * *` causes a Workflow Execution to spawn daily at 8:15 AM UTC.
Use the [crontab guru site](https://crontab.guru/) to test your cron expressions.

### `robfig` predefined schedules and intervals

You can also pass any of the [predefined schedules](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/robfig/cron/v3#hdr-Predefined_schedules) or [intervals](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/robfig/cron/v3#hdr-Intervals) described in the [`robfig/cron` documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/robfig/cron/v3).

```
| Schedules              | Description                                | Equivalent To |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------- |
| @yearly (or @annually) | Run once a year, midnight, Jan. 1st        | 0 0 1 1 *     |
| @monthly               | Run once a month, midnight, first of month | 0 0 1 * *     |
| @weekly                | Run once a week, midnight between Sat/Sun  | 0 0 * * 0     |
| @daily (or @midnight)  | Run once a day, midnight                   | 0 0 * * *     |
| @hourly                | Run once an hour, beginning of hour        | 0 * * * *     |
```

For example, "@weekly" causes a Workflow Execution to spawn once a week at midnight between Saturday and Sunday.

Intervals just take a string that can be accepted by [time.ParseDuration](http://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration).

```
@every <duration>
```

### Time zones

_This feature only applies in Temporal 1.15 and up_

You can change the time zone that a Cron Schedule is interpreted in by prefixing the specification with `CRON_TZ=America/New_York` (or your [desired time zone from tz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones)). `CRON_TZ=America/New_York 15 8 * * *` therefore spawns a Workflow Execution every day at 8:15 AM New York time, subject to caveats listed below.

Consider that using time zones in production introduces a surprising amount of complexity and failure modes!
**If at all possible, we recommend specifying Cron Schedules in UTC (the default)**.

If you need to use time zones, here are a few edge cases to keep in mind:

- **Beware Daylight Saving Time:** If a Temporal Cron Job is scheduled around the time when daylight saving time (DST) begins or ends (for example, `30 2 * * *`), **it might run zero, one, or two times in a day**! The Cron library that we use does not do any special handling of DST transitions. Avoid schedules that include times that fall within DST transition periods.
  - For example, in the US, DST begins at 2 AM. When you "fall back," the clock goes `1:59 … 1:00 … 1:01 … 1:59 … 2:00 … 2:01 AM` and any Cron jobs that fall in that 1 AM hour are fired again. The inverse happens when clocks "spring forward" for DST, and Cron jobs that fall in the 2 AM hour are skipped.
  - In other time zones like Chile and Iran, DST "spring forward" is at midnight. 11:59 PM is followed by 1 AM, which means `00:00:00` never happens.
- **Self Hosting note:** If you manage your own Temporal Cluster, you are responsible for ensuring that it has access to current `tzdata` files. The official Docker images are built with [tzdata](https://docs.w3cub.com/go/time/tzdata/index) installed (provided by Alpine Linux), but ultimately you should be aware of how tzdata is deployed and updated in your infrastructure.
- **Updating Temporal:** If you use the official Docker images, note that an upgrade of the Temporal Cluster may include an update to the tzdata files, which may change the meaning of your Cron Schedule. You should be aware of upcoming changes to the definitions of the time zones you use, particularly around daylight saving time start/end dates.
- **Absolute Time Fixed at Start:** The absolute start time of the next Run is computed and stored in the database when the previous Run completes, and is not recomputed. This means that if you have a Cron Schedule that runs very infrequently, and the definition of the time zone changes between one Run and the next, the Run might happen at the wrong time. For example, `CRON_TZ=America/Los_Angeles 0 12 11 11 *` means "noon in Los Angeles on November 11" (normally not in DST). If at some point the government makes any changes (for example, move the end of DST one week later, or stay on permanent DST year-round), the meaning of that specification changes. In that first year, the Run happens at the wrong time, because it was computed using the older definition.

### How to stop a Temporal Cron Job

A Temporal Cron Job does not stop spawning Runs until it has been Terminated or until the [Workflow Execution Timeout](/workflows#workflow-execution-timeout) is reached.

A Cancellation Request affects only the current Run.

Use the Workflow Id in any requests to Cancel or Terminate.
