## What is the Temporal Platform? {#temporal-platform}

The Temporal Platform consists of a <a class="tdlp" href="/clusters#">Temporal Cluster<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Temporal Cluster?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Temporal Cluster is a Temporal Server paired with Persistence and Visibility stores.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/clusters#">Learn more</a></span></span></a> and <a class="tdlp" href="/workers#worker-process">Worker Processes<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Worker Process?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Worker Process is responsible for polling a Task Queue, dequeueing a Task, executing your code in response to a Task, and responding to the Temporal Server with the results.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workers#worker-process">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.
Together these components create a runtime for Workflow Executions; that is, they create a runtime for your application.

<div class="tdiw"><div class="tditw"><p class="tdit">The Temporal Platform</p></div><div class="tdiiw"><img class="img_ev3q" src="/diagrams/temporal-platform-simple.svg" alt="The Temporal Platform" height="740" width="1140" /></div></div>

The Temporal Cluster is open source and can be operated by you. <a class="tdlp" href="/cloud/index#">Temporal Cloud<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is Temporal Cloud?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">Temporal Cloud is a managed, hosted Temporal environment that provides a platform for Temporal Applications.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/cloud/index#">Learn more</a></span></span></a> is a set of Clusters operated by us.

Worker Processes are hosted and operated by you and execute your code.
They communicate with a Temporal Cluster via gRPC.

<div class="tdiw"><div class="tditw"><p class="tdit">Basic component topology of the Temporal Platform</p></div><div class="tdiiw"><img class="img_ev3q" src="/diagrams/temporal-platform-component-topology.svg" alt="Basic component topology of the Temporal Platform" height="1440" width="1240" /></div></div>

### Temporal versus traditional

In a traditional system, the service exists to spawn function executions.
The Temporal Platform exists to facilitate [Workflow Executions](/workflows#workflow-execution).

<div class="tdiw"><div class="tditw"><p class="tdit">Temporal vs Traditional system</p></div><div class="tdiiw"><img class="img_ev3q" src="/diagrams/temporal-vs-traditional.svg" alt="Temporal vs Traditional system" height="940" width="1280" /></div></div>

Although the two systems seem similar at first glance, they differ in several significant ways.

**Failure**

With a traditional system, a service function execution is both volatile and short-lived.

- If a function execution fails, it's not resumable because all execution state is lost.
  The longer a function execution awaits, the higher the chance of failure.
- A traditional function execution typically has a limited lifespan, often measured in minutes.

With Temporal, a Workflow Execution is resumable.

- A Workflow Execution is fully resumable after a failure.
- Temporal imposes no deadlines on Workflow Executions.

**State**

With a traditional system, stoppage or failure means that all execution state is lost.
Your application (or a supporting component) must monitor the service's response to initiate a retry of the service execution.
A retry starts from its _initial_ state.

With Temporal, computation resumes from its _latest_ state.
All progress is retained.

**Communication**

With a traditional system, you can't communicate with a function execution.

With Temporal, <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#signal">Signals<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Signal?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Signal is an asynchronous request to a Workflow Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#signal">Learn more</a></span></span></a> and <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#query">Queries<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Query?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Query is a synchronous operation that is used to report the state of a Workflow Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#query">Learn more</a></span></span></a> enable data to be sent to or extracted from a Workflow Execution.

**Scope**

With a traditional system, a service function execution can at best represent a business process.
Typically, it represents only a part of a business process.

A Temporal Workflow Execution can represent a business process or an entire business object.

### Failure mitigation

The Temporal Platform addresses both platform-level failures and application-level failures.

#### Platform-level failure

A platform-level failure is a failure that occurs within the underlying platform or infrastructure that supports an application or system.
This type of failure can often be transparent to the application, meaning it is not directly visible to the user or application and can be detected and mitigated at a platform level.

Temporal insulates your application from platform-level failures, and any failure that can be handled transparently is pushed into the platform.
In Temporal, platform-level failures include network issues, process crashes, hardware failures, and transient errors in downstream services or third-party APIs.

#### Application-level failure

Conversely, an application-level failure is a failure that occurs within the application itself.
This type of failure is directly visible to the user or application and must be detected and mitigated at the application level.

Temporal cannot mitigate application-level failures for you, but Temporal greatly simplifies handling failures and debugging your application.
An example of an application-level failure could be an error in the application's code or a problem with the input data being used by the application.

#### Failure handling

Failure handling is an essential part of an application.
[Temporal Failures](/kb/failures) is a list of the types of errors that occur in the system.

For languages that throw (or raise) errors (or exceptions), throwing an error that is not a Temporal Failure from a Workflow fails the <a class="tdlp" href="/workers#workflow-task">Workflow Task<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Workflow Task?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Workflow Task is a Task that contains the context needed to make progress with a Workflow Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workers#workflow-task">Learn more</a></span></span></a> (and the Task will be retried until it succeeds), whereas throwing a Temporal Failure (or letting a Temporal Failure propagate from Temporal calls, like an [Activity Failure](/kb/failures#activity-failure) from an Activity call) fails the <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#workflow-execution">Workflow Execution<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Workflow Execution?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Temporal Workflow Execution is a durable, scalable, reliable, and reactive function execution.

## What is a Temporal Application? {#temporal-application}

A Temporal Application is a set of [Temporal Workflow Executions](/workflows#workflow-execution).
Each Temporal Workflow Execution has exclusive access to its local state, executes concurrently to all other Workflow Executions, and communicates with other Workflow Executions and the environment via message passing.

A Temporal Application can consist of millions to billions of Workflow Executions.
Workflow Executions are lightweight components.
A Workflow Execution consumes few compute resources; in fact, if a Workflow Execution is suspended, such as when it is in a waiting state, the Workflow Execution consumes no compute resources at all.

**Reentrant Process**

A Temporal Workflow Execution is a Reentrant Process. A Reentrant Process is resumable, recoverable, and reactive.

- Resumable: Ability of a process to continue execution after execution was suspended on an _awaitable_.
- Recoverable: Ability of a process to continue execution after execution was suspended on a _failure_.
- Reactive: Ability of a process to react to external events.

Therefore, a Temporal Workflow Execution executes a <a class="tdlp" href="/workflows#workflow-definition">Temporal Workflow Definition<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Workflow Definition?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Workflow Definition is the code that defines the constraints of a Workflow Execution.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/workflows#workflow-definition">Learn more</a></span></span></a>, also called a Temporal Workflow Function, your application code, exactly once and to completion—whether your code executes for seconds or years, in the presence of arbitrary load and arbitrary failures.

## What is a Temporal SDK? {#temporal-sdk}

A Temporal SDK is a language-specific library that offers APIs to do the following:

1. Construct and use a <a class="tdlp" href="#temporal-client">Temporal Client<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Temporal Client?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Temporal Client, provided by a Temporal SDK, provides a set of APIs to communicate with a Temporal Cluster.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="#temporal-client">Learn more</a></span></span></a>

A Temporal SDK enables you to write your application code using the full power of the programming language, while the Temporal Platform handles the durability, reliability, and scalability of the application.

Temporal currently offers the following SDKs:

### Auth

Temporal offers methods of authenticating and authorizing client API calls within our SDKs.

### Sandbox environment

Some SDKs support running Workflows inside a sandbox environment.

The Temporal Python SDK, for example, enables you to run Workflow code in a sandbox environment to help prevent non-determinism errors in your application.
The Temporal Workflow Sandbox for Python is not completely isolated, and some libraries can internally mutate state, which can result in breaking determinism.

By default, Workflows run in a sandbox environment.
If a Workflow Execution performs a non-deterministic event, an exception is thrown, which results in failing the Workflow Task.
The Workflow will not progress until the code is fixed.

For more information, see the knowledge base article on [Python sandbox environments](/kb/python-sandbox-environment).

### SDKs in development

The following SDKs are in alpha/pre-alpha development stages, but are not yet supported in the Developer's guide:

- [.NET](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-dotnet)
- [Rust](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core)
- [Ruby](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-ruby)

### Third-party SDKs

The following third-party SDKs exist but are not supported in the [Developer's guide](/dev-guide):

- [Clojure](https://github.com/manetu/temporal-clojure-sdk) - from [@Manetu](https://github.com/manetu)
- [Scala](https://github.com/vitaliihonta/zio-temporal) from [@vitaliihonta](https://github.com/vitaliihonta)
- [Ruby](https://github.com/coinbase/temporal-ruby) from [@coinbase](https://github.com/coinbase)

### What is a Temporal Client? {#temporal-client}

A Temporal Client is available in each SDK and provides a set of APIs to communicate with a <a class="tdlp" href="/clusters#">Temporal Cluster<span class="tdlpiw"><img src="/img/link-preview-icon.svg" alt="Link preview icon" /></span><span class="tdlpc"><span class="tdlppt">What is a Temporal Cluster?</span><br /><br /><span class="tdlppd">A Temporal Cluster is a Temporal Server paired with Persistence and Visibility stores.</span><span class="tdlplm"><br /><br /><a class="tdlplma" href="/clusters#">Learn more</a></span></span></a>.

The most common operations that a Temporal Client enables you to perform are the following:

- Get the result of Workflow Execution.
- List Workflow Executions.
- Query a Workflow Execution.
- Signal a Workflow Execution.
- Start a Workflow Execution.
