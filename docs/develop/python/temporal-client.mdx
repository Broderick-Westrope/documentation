## How to install the Temporal CLI and run a development server {#run-a-development-server}

This section describes how to install the [Temporal CLI](/cli) and run a development Cluster.
The local development Cluster comes packaged with the [Temporal Web UI](/web-ui).

For information on deploying and running a self-hosted production Cluster, see the [Self-hosted guide](/self-hosted-guide), or sign up for [Temporal Cloud](/cloud) and let us run your production Cluster for you.

Temporal CLI is a tool for interacting with a Temporal Cluster from the command line and it includes a distribution of the Temporal Server and Web UI.
This local development Cluster runs as a single process with zero runtime dependencies and it supports persistence to disk and in-memory mode through SQLite.

**Install the Temporal CLI**

Choose one of the following install methods to install the Temporal CLI.

<Tabs>

  ```bash
  brew install temporal
  ```

  ```bash
  curl -sSf https://temporal.download/cli.sh | sh
  ```

- Install the Temporal CLI from CDN.
  1. Select the platform and architecture needed.
     - <a href="https://temporal.download/cli/archive/latest?platform=darwin&arch=amd64">Download for Darwin amd64</a>
     - <a href="https://temporal.download/cli/archive/latest?platform=darwin&arch=arm64">Download for Darwin arm64</a>
  2. Extract the downloaded archive.
  3. Add the `temporal` binary to your PATH.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

**Start the Temporal Development Server**

Start the Temporal Development Server by using the `server start-dev` command.

```bash
temporal server start-dev
```

This command automatically starts the Web UI, creates the default [Namespace](/namespaces), and uses an in-memory database.

The Temporal Server should be available on `localhost:7233` and the Temporal Web UI should be accessible at [`http://localhost:8233`](http://localhost:8233/).

The server's startup configuration can be customized using command line options.
For a full list of options, run:

```bash
temporal server start-dev --help
```

## How to connect a Temporal Client to a Temporal Cluster {#connect-to-a-dev-cluster}

A [Temporal Client](/encyclopedia/temporal-sdks#temporal-client) enables you to communicate with the [Temporal Cluster](/clusters).
Communication with a Temporal Cluster includes, but isn't limited to, the following:

- Starting Workflow Executions.
- Sending Signals to Workflow Executions.
- Sending Queries to Workflow Executions.
- Getting the results of a Workflow Execution.
- Providing an Activity Task Token.

:::caution

A Temporal Client cannot be initialized and used inside a Workflow.
However, it is acceptable and common to use a Temporal Client inside an Activity to communicate with a Temporal Cluster.

:::

When you are running a Cluster locally (such as the [Temporal CLI](https://docs.temporal.io/cli/server#start-dev)), the number of connection options you must provide is minimal.
Many SDKs default to the local host or IP address and port that Temporalite and [Docker Compose](https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose) serve (`127.0.0.1:7233`).

Use the `connect()` method on the Client class to create and connect to a Temporal Client to the Temporal Cluster.

  <a href="https://github.com/temporalio/documentation/blob/main/sample-apps/python/your_app/run_workflow_dacx.py">
    View the source code
  </a>{" "}
  in the context of the rest of the application code.
</div>

```python

# ...
async def main():
    client = await Client.connect("localhost:7233")

    result = await client.execute_workflow(
        YourWorkflow.run,
        "your name",
        id="your-workflow-id",
        task_queue="your-task-queue",
    )

    print(f"Result: {result}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## How to connect to Temporal Cloud {#connect-to-temporal-cloud}

When you connect to [Temporal Cloud](/cloud), you need to provide additional connection and client options that include the following:

- The [Temporal Cloud Namespace Id](/cloud/namespaces#temporal-cloud-namespace-id).
- The [Namespace's gRPC endpoint](/cloud/namespaces#temporal-cloud-grpc-endpoint).
  An endpoint listing is available at the [Temporal Cloud Website](https://cloud.temporal.io/namespaces) on each Namespace detail page.
  The endpoint contains the Namespace Id and port.
- mTLS CA certificate.
- mTLS private key.

For more information about managing and generating client certificates for Temporal Cloud, see [How to manage certificates in Temporal Cloud](/cloud/certificates).

For more information about configuring TLS to secure inter- and intra-network communication for a Temporal Cluster, see [Temporal Customization Samples](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-server).

Use the `connect()` method on the Client class to create and connect to a Temporal Client to the Temporal Cluster.
Then specify the [TLSConfig](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.service.TLSConfig.html) arguments to connect to a Temporal Cluster with TLS enabled.
The `client_cert` must be combined with `client_private_key` to authenticate the Client.

  <a href="https://github.com/temporalio/documentation/blob/main/sample-apps/python/your_app/connect_cloud_dacx.py">

  </a>{" "}
  in the context of the rest of the application code.
</div>

```python

from temporalio.client import Client, TLSConfig
# ...
# ...
async def main():
    with open("client-cert.pem", "rb") as f:
        client_cert = f.read()
    with open("client-private-key.pem", "rb") as f:
        client_private_key = f.read()
    client = await Client.connect(
        "your-custom-namespace.tmprl.cloud:7233",
        namespace="<your-custom-namespace>.<id>",
        tls=TLSConfig(
            client_cert=client_cert,
            client_private_key=client_private_key,
            # domain=domain, # TLS domain
            # server_root_ca_cert=server_root_ca_cert, # ROOT CA to validate the server cert
        ),
    )
```
