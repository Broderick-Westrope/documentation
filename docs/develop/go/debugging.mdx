You can use a debugger tool provided by your favorite IDE to debug your Workflow Definitions prior to testing or executing them.

The Temporal Go SDK includes deadlock detection which fails a Workflow Task in case the code blocks over a second without relinquishing execution control.
Because of this you can often encounter a `PanicError: Potential deadlock detected` while stepping through Workflow Definitions during debugging.

To alleviate this issue, you can set the `TEMPORAL_DEBUG` environment variable to `true` before debugging your Workflow Definition.

:::note

Make sure to set `TEMPORAL_DEBUG` to true only during debugging.

## Debug in a development environment {#debug-in-a-development-environment}

**How to debug in a development environment using the Go SDK**

In addition to the normal development tools of logging and a debugger, you can also see what's happening in your Workflow by using the [Web UI](/web-ui) or [Temporal CLI](/cli).

## Debug in a production environment {#debug-in-a-production-environment}

**How to debug in a production environment using the Go SDK**

You can debug production Workflows using:

- [Web UI](/web-ui)
- [Temporal CLI](/cli)
- [Replay](/develop/go/testing-suite#replay)
- [Tracing](/develop/go/observability#tracing-and-context-propogation)
- [Logging](/develop/go/observability#logging)

You can debug and tune Worker performance with metrics and the [Worker performance guide](/develop/worker-performance).
For more information, see [Metrics](/develop/go/observability#metrics) for setting up SDK metrics.

Debug Server performance with [Cloud metrics](/cloud/metrics/) or [self-hosted Server metrics](/self-hosted-guide/production-checklist#scaling-and-metrics).
