These Temporal Java SDK feature guides aim to show how to use Temporal features when developing [Temporal Applications](/temporal#temporal-application).

## Core application

The [Core Application feature guide](/develop/java/core-application) shows how to use the basic building blocks of a Temporal Application (Workflows, Activities, and Workers).

- [How to develop a Workflow Definition in Java](/develop/java/core-application#develop-workflows)
- [How to develop a basic Activity](/develop/java/core-application#develop-activities)
- [How to start an Activity Execution](/develop/java/core-application#activity-execution)
- [How to develop a Worker Program in Java](/develop/java/core-application#run-a-dev-worker)

## Temporal Client

The [Temporal Client feature guide](/develop/java/temporal-clients) shows how to connect to a Temporal Service and start a Workflow Execution.

- [Connect to a development Temporal Service](/develop/java/temporal-clients#connect-to-development-service)
- [Connect to a custom Namespace](/develop/java/temporal-clients#connect-to-custom-namespace)
- [Connect to Temporal Cloud](/develop/java/temporal-clients#connect-to-temporal-cloud)
- [Start a Workflow Execution](/develop/java/temporal-clients#start-workflow-execution)

## Testing suites

The [Testing suite feature guide](/develop/java/test-suites) shows how to set up the testing suite and test Workflows and Activities.

- [Test frameworks](/develop/java/test-suites#test-frameworks)
- [Test Activities](/develop/java/test-suites#test-activities)
- [Testing Workflows](/develop/java/test-suites#test-workflows)
- [How to Replay a Workflow Execution](/develop/java/test-suites#replay)

## Failure detection

The [Failure detection feature guide](/develop/java/failure-detection) shows how your application can detect failures using timeouts and automatically attempt to mitigate them with retries.

- [Workflow timeouts](/develop/java/failure-detection#workflow-timeouts)
- [How to set Activity timeouts](/develop/java/failure-detection#activity-timeouts)
- [How to Heartbeat an Activity](/develop/java/failure-detection#activity-heartbeats)

## Messages

The [Application messages feature guide](/develop/java/message-passing) shows how to send messages to and read the state of Workflow Executions.

- [How to develop with Signals](/develop/java/message-passing#signals)
- [How to develop with Queries](/develop/java/message-passing#queries)
- [What is a Dynamic Handler?](/develop/java/message-passing#dynamic-handler)
- [How to develop with Updates](/develop/java/message-passing#updates)

## Asynchronous Activity Completion

The [Asynchronous Activity Completion feature guide](/develop/java/asynchronous-activity-completion) shows how to complete Activities asynchronously.

- [How to asynchronously complete an Activity](/develop/java/asynchronous-activity-completion#asynchronous-activity-completion)

## Versioning

The [Versioning feature guide](/develop/java/versioning) shows how to change Workflow Definitions without causing non-deterministic behavior in current long-running Workflows.

- [How to patch Workflows in Java](/develop/java/versioning#patching)
- [How to use Worker Versioning in Java](/develop/java/versioning#worker-versioning)

## Observability

The [Observability feature guide](/develop/java/observability) shows how to configure and use the Temporal Observability APIs.

- [How to emit metrics](/develop/java/observability#metrics)
- [How to setup Tracing](/develop/java/observability#tracing)
- [How to log from a Workflow](/develop/java/observability#logging)
- [How to use Visibility APIs](/develop/java/observability#visibility)

## Debugging

The [Debugging feature guide](/develop/java/debugging) covers the various ways to debug your application.

- [How to debug in a development environment](/develop/java/debugging#debug-in-a-development-environment)
- [How to debug in a production environment](/develop/java/debugging#debug-in-a-production-environment)

## Schedules

The [Schedules feature guide](/develop/java/schedules) shows how to schedule Workflows, run Workflows on a Cron, and to delay the start of a Workflow.

- [How to Schedule a Workflow](/develop/java/schedules#schedule-a-workflow)
- [How to set a Cron Schedule in Java](/develop/java/schedules#cron-schedule)

## Data encryption

The [Data encryption feature guide](/develop/java/data-encryption) provides guidance on how to support compression, encryption, and other data handling by implementing custom converters and codecs.

- [How to use a custom Payload Codec in Java](/develop/java/data-encryption#custom-payload-codec)
- [How to use custom Payload conversion](/develop/java/data-encryption#custom-payload-conversion)

## Child Workflows

The [Child Workflows feature guide](/develop/java/child-workflows) shows how to spawn a Child Workflow Execution and handle Child Workflow Events.

- [How to start a Child Workflow Execution](/develop/java/child-workflows#child-workflows)

## Continue-As-New

The [Continue-As-New feature guide](/develop/java/continue-as-new) shows how to continue the Workflow Execution with a new Workflow Execution using the same Workflow ID.

- [How to Continue-As-New](/develop/java/continue-as-new#continue-as-new)

## Timers

The [Durable Timers feature guide](/develop/java/timers) shows how to use Timers and sleep within Workflows.

- [What is a Timer?](/develop/java/timers#timers)

## Side Effects

The [Side Effects feature guide](/develop/java/side-effects) covers how to use Side Effects in Workflows.

- [Side Effects](/develop/java/side-effects#side-effects)

## Manage Namespaces

The [Manage Namespaces feature guide](/develop/java/namespaces) covers how to create and manage Namespaces.

- [How to create and manage Namespaces](/develop/java/namespaces#namespaces)
