## Writing message handlers

The code samples below form part of a complete working sample, viewable at [message_passing/introduction](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-dotnet/tree/main/src/MessagePassing).

General guidelines for writing message handlers:

- Arguments and return values of handlers (and the main Workflow function) must be [serializable](/data-encryption): a `record` will often be the right choice.

- It's possible to write handler methods that take multiple arguments, but this is not recommended: instead use a single record argument to which fields can be added as needed.


### Query handlers {#handle-query}

A [Query](/encyclopedia/workflow-message-passing#sending-queries) is a synchronous operation that's used to get the state of a Workflow Execution. This can be defined as a method:

```csharp
[Workflow]
public class GreetingWorkflow
{
    public enum Language
    {
        Chinese,
        English,
        French,
        Spanish,
        Portuguese,
    }

    public record GetLanguagesInput(bool IncludeUnsupported);

    // ...

    [WorkflowQuery]
    public IList<Language> GetLanguages(GetLanguagesInput input) =>
        Enum.GetValues<Language>().
            Where(language => input.IncludeUnsupported || Greetings.ContainsKey(language)).
            ToList();

    // ...
```

Or as a property getter:

```csharp
[Workflow]
public class GreetingWorkflow
{
    public enum Language
    {
        Chinese,
        English,
        French,
        Spanish,
        Portuguese,
    }

    // ...

    [WorkflowQuery]
    public Language CurrentLanguage { get; private set; } = Language.English;

    // ...
```

- The attribute can take arguments. See the API reference docs: [`WorkflowQueryAttribute`](https://dotnet.temporal.io/api/Temporalio.Workflows.WorkflowQueryAttribute.html).

- A Query handler method can be a property getter or a non-async method. You can't do async operations such as executing an Activity in a Query handler.

### Signal handlers {#handle-signal}

A [Signal](/encyclopedia/workflow-message-passing#sending-signals) is a message sent asynchronously to a running Workflow Execution which can be used to change the state and control the flow of a Workflow Execution.

```csharp
[Workflow]
public class GreetingWorkflow
{
    public record ApproveInput(string Name);

    // ...

    [WorkflowSignal]
    public async Task ApproveAsync(ApproveInput input)
    {
        approvedForRelease = true;
        approverName = input.Name;
    }

    // ...
```

- The attribute can take arguments. See the API reference docs: [`WorkflowSignalAttribute`](https://dotnet.temporal.io/api/Temporalio.Workflows.WorkflowSignalAttribute.html).

- The handler should not return a value: it will be ignored (the sender of a signal gets a response immediately from the server, without waiting for the workflow to receive the signal).

- Signal (and Update) handlers can `async` and thus use Activities, Child Workflows, durable `Workflow.DelayAsync` timers, `Workflow.WaitConditionAsync` conditions, etc. See [Async handlers](#async-handlers) below, and read [Workflow message passing](/encyclopedia/workflow-message-passing) for an introduction to safe usage of async Signal and Update handlers.

### Update handlers and validators {#handle-update}

An [Update](/encyclopedia/workflow-message-passing#sending-updates) is a trackable request sent synchronously to a running Workflow Execution that can change the state and control the flow of a Workflow Execution, and return a result. The sender of the request must wait until the Update is at least accepted or rejected by a Worker, and will often opt to wait further to receive the value returned by the Update handler, or an exception indicating what went wrong.

```csharp
[Workflow]
public class GreetingWorkflow
{
    public enum Language
    {
        Chinese,
        English,
        French,
        Spanish,
        Portuguese,
    }

    // ...

    [WorkflowUpdateValidator(nameof(SetCurrentLanguageAsync))]
    public void ValidateLanguage(Language language)
    {
        if (!Greetings.ContainsKey(language))
        {
            throw new ApplicationFailureException($"{language} is not supported");
        }
    }

    [WorkflowUpdate]
    public async Task<Language> SetCurrentLanguageAsync(Language language)
    {
        var previousLanguage = CurrentLanguage;
        CurrentLanguage = language;
        return previousLanguage;
    }

    // ...
```

- The attribute can take arguments. See the API reference docs: [`WorkflowUpdateAttribute`](https://dotnet.temporal.io/api/Temporalio.Workflows.WorkflowUpdateAttribute.html).

- Validators are optional; if you don't want to be able to reject updates then you don't need a validator.

- The validator is defined with the [`WorkflowUpdateValidatorAttribute'](https://dotnet.temporal.io/api/Temporalio.Workflows.WorkflowUpdateValidatorAttribute.html) attribute.
  The validator must take the same argument type as the handler, but always returns `void`.

- To reject an Update, you throw an exception (of any type) in the validator.

- Update (and Signal) handlers are often `async` and thus use Activities, Child Workflows, durable `Workflow.DelayAsync` timers, `Workflow.WaitConditionAsync` conditions, etc. See [Async handlers](#async-handlers) below, and read [Workflow message passing](/encyclopedia/workflow-message-passing) for an introduction to safe usage of async Signal and Update handlers.


## Sending messages

To send Queries, Signals, or Updates you call methods on a `WorkflowHandle` object.
To obtain the Workflow handle, you can:
- Use `StartWorkflowAsync` to start a Workflow and return its handle.
- Use the `GetWorkflowHandle` method to get a Workflow handle.

For example:

```csharp
var client = await TemporalClient.ConnectAsync(new("localhost:7233"));
var workflowHandle = await client.StartWorkflowAsync(
    (GreetingWorkflow wf) => wf.RunAsync(),
    new(id: "message-passing-workflow-id", taskQueue: "message-passing-sample"));
```

To find out what argument type to provide (and what return type to expect for Queries and Updates), look at the corresponding handler method on the Workflow Definition.

### Sending a Query {#send-query}

Use `WorkflowHandle.QueryAsync`.


```csharp
var supportedLanguages = await workflowHandle.QueryAsync(wf => wf.GetLanguages(new(false)));
```
- Sending a Query does not add any events to the Workflow's Event History.
- You can send a Query to a Workflow Execution that has closed.

### Sending a Signal

- A Signal can only be sent to a Workflow Execution that has not already closed.
- A Signal can be sent to a Workflow Execution from a Temporal Client or from another Workflow Execution.

#### Sending a Signal from a Client {#send-signal-from-client}

Use `WorkflowHandle.SignalAsync`.

```csharp
await workflowHandle.SignalAsync(wf => wf.ApproveAsync(new("MyUser")));
```
- The call will return as soon as the server accepts the Signal: it does _not_ wait for the Signal to be delivered to the Workflow Execution.
- The [WorkflowExecutionSignaled](/references/events#workflowexecutionsignaled) Event appears in the Workflow's Event History if the Server accepts the Signal.


#### Sending a Signal from a Workflow {#send-signal-from-workflow}

A Workflow can send a Signal to another Workflow, in which case it's called an _External Signal_.

In this case you need to obtain a Workflow handle for the external Workflow:
- Use `Workflow.GetExternalWorkflowHandle` to get a typed Workflow handle to an existing Workflow.

```csharp
// ...

[Workflow]
public class WorkflowB
{
    [WorkflowRun]
    public async Task RunAsync()
    {
        var handle = Workflow.GetExternalWorkflowHandle<WorkflowA>("workflow-a");
        await handle.SignalAsync(wf => wf.YourSignalAsync("signal argument"));
    }

    // ...
```
When an External Signal is sent:
- A [SignalExternalWorkflowExecutionInitiated](/references/events#signalexternalworkflowexecutioninitiated) Event appears in the sender's Event History.
- A [WorkflowExecutionSignaled](/references/events#workflowexecutionsignaled) Event appears in the recipient's Event History.

#### Signal-With-Start {#signal-with-start}

Signal-With-Start is sent by a Client.
To send a Signal-With-Start, use the `StartWorkflowAsync` method and use `SignalWithStart` method on the options with the name of your Signal and the arguments.

If there's a Workflow running with the given Workflow Id, the Signal will be sent to it. If there isn't, a new Workflow will be started and the Signal will be sent immediately on start.

```csharp
var client = await TemporalClient.ConnectAsync(new("localhost:7233"));
var options = new WorkflowOptions(id: "your-signal-with-start-workflow", taskQueue: "signal-tq");
options.SignalWithStart((GreetingWorkflow wf) => wf.SubmitGreetingAsync("User Signal with Start"));
await client.StartWorkflowAsync((GreetingWorkflow wf) => wf.RunAsync(), options);
```

### Sending an Update {#send-update}

- A client sending an Update must be prepared to wait until the Server has delivered the Update to the Worker: that means that the Worker must not be offline, and must not respond too slowly.
  If you want the server to send a response as soon as it receives your request, then you must use a Signal instead. 
- `WorkflowExecutionUpdateAccepted` will be added to Event History when the Worker has responded to the Server that the Update passed validation.
- `WorkflowExecutionUpdateCompleted` will be added to Event History when the Worker has responded to the Server that the Update has completed.


It is not yet possible to send an Update to another Workflow, or to do the Update equivalent of Signal-With-Start.

To send an Update to a Workflow Execution, you have two choices:

#### 1. Use `ExecuteUpdateAsync` to wait for the update to complete

`ExecuteUpdateAsync` sends an Update and waits until it has been completed by a Worker. It returns the Update result:

```csharp
var previousLanguage = await workflowHandle.ExecuteUpdateAsync(
    wf => wf.SetCurrentLanguageAsync(GreetingWorkflow.Language.Chinese));
```

#### 2. Use `StartUpdateAsync` to receive a handle as soon as the update is accepted or rejected

`StartUpdateAsync` sends an Update and waits until the Update has been accepted or rejected by a Worker. It returns an `UpdateHandle`:

You would use this when the Update handler does some long-running async activity (i.e. it uses `await` to wait for Activities, Child Workflows, timers, or `Workflow.WaitConditionAsync`), but you don't want to wait for all this activity to be finished; instead you want to wait only until the Worker has accepted or rejected the Update.
See the "Async handlers" section.


```csharp
// Wait until the update is accepted
var updateHandle = await workflowHandle.StartUpdateAsync(
    wf => wf.SetGreetingAsync(new HelloWorldInput("World")));
// Wait until the update is completed
var updateResult = await updateHandle.GetResultAsync();
```

#### Non-type safe APIs

Note that all the sample code in this document assumes that you can import the Workflow Definition.
If you do not have access to the Workflow Definition (or it is not written in .NET) then you can still do everything documented here by using non type-safe APIs.
This involves passing method names instead of method objects to `ITemporalClient.StartWorkflowAsync` / `WorkflowHandle.QueryAsync` / `WorkflowHandle.SignalAsync` / `WorkflowHandle.ExecuteUpdateAsync` / `WorkflowHandle.StartUpdateAsync`, and using the non type-safe APIs `ITemporalClient.GetWorkflowHandle` and `Workflow.GetExternalWorkflowHandle`.


## Exceptions

🚧 This section is still in-progress 🚧

As a client, when you send a Signal, Update, or Query to a Workflow, the following two errors are always possible:

1. **The client can't contact the server**

   You'll get an [`Temporalio.Exceptions.RpcException`](https://dotnet.temporal.io/api/Temporalio.Exceptions.RpcException.html) on which the `Code` property is [`RpcException.StatusCode`](https://dotnet.temporal.io/api/Temporalio.Exceptions.RpcException.StatusCode.html) `Unavailable` (after some retries; see the `RpcRetry` property on the client connection options).

1. **The workflow does not exist**

   You'll get an [`Temporalio.Exceptions.RpcException`](https://dotnet.temporal.io/api/Temporalio.Exceptions.RpcException.html) on which the `Code` property is [`RpcException.StatusCode`](https://dotnet.temporal.io/api/Temporalio.Exceptions.RpcException.StatusCode.html) `NotFound`.

For Signal, these `RpcException`s are the only types of exception that will result from the request, since the client gets a response without waiting for the Signal to be delivered to the Worker.

The situation is different for Query and Update since for these the client waits for a response for the Worker, and so the client may get an exception indicating that something went wrong while the handler was being executed by the Workflow Worker. There are three types of error that could occur:

1. **The handler caused the Workflow Task to fail.**

1. **You sent an Update and the Update failed.**

   Update failure is analogous to Workflow failure in the sense that all the things that cause Workflow failure when they happen in the main Workflow method, cause Update failure when they happen in an Update handler. 
   Examples of things that cause Update/Workflow failure in this way include:
     - A failed Child Workflow
     - A failed Activity (if the activity retries have been set to a finite number)
     - The Workflow author raising `ApplicationFailureException`
     - Any error listed in []`TemporalWorkerOptions.WorkflowFailureExceptionTypes`](https://dotnet.temporal.io/api/Temporalio.Worker.TemporalWorkerOptions.html#Temporalio_Worker_TemporalWorkerOptions_WorkflowFailureExceptionTypes) on the worker or [`WorkflowAttribute.FailureExceptionTypes`](https://dotnet.temporal.io/api/Temporalio.Workflows.WorkflowAttribute.html#Temporalio_Workflows_WorkflowAttribute_FailureExceptionTypes) on the workflow (empty by default)

1. **You sent a Query and the Query failed.**

See also [Failures](/references/failures).



Of course, it's possible that the handler you triggered caused the Workflow to fail.
You'll get the resulting exception when you try to do `await workflowHandle.GetResultAsync()`.


The following exceptions might be raised by `ExecuteUpdateAsync`, or when calling `updateHandle.GetResultAsync` on a handle obtained from `StartUpdateAsync`:

- [`Temporalio.Exceptions.WorkflowUpdateFailedException`](https://dotnet.temporal.io/api/Temporalio.Exceptions.WorkflowUpdateFailedException.html)

  This is the error you'll see if the Update was rejected by the validator, or the update was failed after having been accepted.

- [`Temporalio.Exceptions.RpcException`](https://dotnet.temporal.io/api/Temporalio.Exceptions.RpcException.html) "workflow execution already completed"`

  This will happen if the Workflow finished while the Update handler execution was in progress, for example because
  - The Workflow was canceled or was deliberately failed (the Workflow author raised [`ApplicationFailureException`](https://dotnet.temporal.io/api/Temporalio.Exceptions.ApplicationFailureException.html) outside an Update handler)
  - The Workflow completed normally or continued-as-new and the Workflow author did not [wait for handlers to be finished](/encyclopedia/workflow-message-passing#finishing-message-handlers).

If the Workflow handle references a Workflow that doesn't exist then `ExecuteUpdateAsync` and `StartUpdateAsync` will both raise [`Temporalio.Exceptions.RpcException`](https://dotnet.temporal.io/api/Temporalio.Exceptions.RpcException.html) with a `NotFound` code.


## Message handler patterns {#message-handler-patterns}

In addition to the topics below, see [Inject work into the main Workflow](/encyclopedia/workflow-message-passing#injecting-work-into-main-workflow) and [Ensuring your messages are processed exactly once](/encyclopedia/workflow-message-passing#exactly-once-message-processing).

### Async handlers {#async-handlers}
Signal and update handlers can be `async`.
This allows them to use `await` to wait for Activities, Child Workflows, `Workflow.DelayAsync` timers, `Workflow.WaitConditionAsync` conditions, etc, thus opening up many powerful possibilities.
However, this means that handler executions, and your main Workflow method, are all running concurrently, with switching occurring between them at `await` calls.
(I.e. they interleave, but there is no parallelism.)
It's essential to understand the things that could go wrong in order to use `async` handlers safely.
See [Workflow message passing](/encyclopedia/workflow-message-passing) for guidance on safe usage of async Signal and Update handlers, the [Safe message handlers](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-dotnet/tree/main/src/SafeMessageHandlers) sample, and the [Controlling handler concurrency](#control-handler-concurrency) and [Waiting for message handlers to finish](#wait-for-message-handlers) sections below.


As an example of an async handler, in the following code sample the Update handler can execute an Activity to make a network call to a remote service:

```csharp
public class MyActivities
{
    private static readonly Dictionary<Language, string> Greetings = new()
    {
        [Language.Arabic] = "مرحبا بالعالم",
        [Language.Chinese] = "你好，世界",
        [Language.English] = "Hello, world",
        [Language.French] = "Bonjour, monde",
        [Language.Hindi] = "नमस्ते दुनिया",
        [Language.Spanish] = "Hola mundo",
    };

    [Activity]
    public async Task<string?> CallGreetingServiceAsync(Language language)
    {
        // Pretend that we are calling a remove service
        await Task.Delay(200);
        return Greetings.TryGetValue(language, out var value) ? value : null;
    }
}
```

```csharp
[Workflow]
public class GreetingWorkflow
{
    // ...

    [WorkflowUpdate]
    public async Task<Language> SetLanguageAsync(Language language)
    {
        if (!greetings.ContainsKey(language))
        {
            var greeting = Workflow.ExecuteActivityAsync(
                (MyActivities acts) => acts.CallGreetingServiceAsync(language),
                new() { StartToCloseTimeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10) });
            if (greeting == null)
            {
                // 👉 An update validator cannot be async, so cannot be used to check that the remote
                // CallGreetingServiceAsync supports the requested language. Throwing ApplicationFailureException
                // will fail the Update, but the WorkflowExecutionUpdateAccepted event will still be
                // added to history.
                throw new ApplicationFailureException(
                    $"Greeting service does not support {language}");
            }
            greetings[language] = greeting;
        }
        var previousLanguage = CurrentLanguage;
        CurrentLanguage = langauge;
        return previousLanguage;
    }
}
```

The Update handler is now able to schedule an Activity and wait for the result -- but this could be done with a Signal handler also.
In contrast to a Signal, the client sending the Update will not get an Update result until the Activity has completed and the Workflow has received a response or error from the remote service.

#### Waiting
`Workflow.WaitConditionAsync` is very useful in Temporal Workflow Definitions.
It allows Workflow code to wait until an arbitrary function returns `rrue`.

For example, in an `async` handler it could be used to wait until the handler execution can proceed, according to Workflow implementation logic:
```csharp
    [WorkflowUpdate]
    public async Task<string> MyUpdateAsync(UpdateInput updateInput)
    {
        await Workflow.WaitConditionAsync(() => ReadyForUpdateToExecute(updateInput));
        // ...
    }
```

This is necessary if your Signal or Update handlers require something in the main Workflow method to be done first, since a Signal or Update handler can execute before the main Workflow method has started.

#### Use `Workflows.Mutex` to prevent concurrent handler execution {#control-handler-concurrency}
See [Message handler concurrency](/encyclopedia/workflow-message-passing#message-handler-concurrency).

Sometimes you may write code that is incorrect if multiple instances of a handler are in progress concurrently.
Here's an example:

```csharp
[Workflow]
public class MyWorkflow
{
    // ...

    [WorkflowSignal]
    public async Task BadHandlerAsync()
    {
        var data = await Workflow.ExecuteActivityAsync(
            (MyActivities acts) => acts.FetchDataAsync(),
            new() { StartToCloseTimeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10) });
        this.x = data.X;
        // 🐛🐛 Bug!! If multiple instances of this handler are executing concurrently, then
        // there may be times when the Workflow has this.x from one Activity execution and this.y from another.
        await Workflow.DelayAsync(1000);
        this.y = data.Y;
    }
}
```
To make this save, you can use `Workflows.Mutex`:
```csharp
[Workflow]
public class MyWorkflow
{
    private readonly Mutex mutex = new();

    // ...

    [WorkflowSignal]
    public async Task SafeHandlerAsync()
    {
        await mutex.WaitOneAsync();
        try
        {
            var data = await Workflow.ExecuteActivityAsync(
                (MyActivities acts) => acts.FetchDataAsync(),
                new() { StartToCloseTimeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10) });
            this.x = data.X;
            // ✅ OK: the scheduler may switch now to a different handler execution, or to the main workflow
            // method, but no other execution of this handler can run until this execution finishes.
            await Workflow.DelayAsync(1000);
            this.y = data.Y;
        }
        finally
        {
            mutex.ReleaseMutex();
        }
    }
}
```

`Workflows.Semaphore` also exists for more concurrency control.

#### Finishing handlers before the Workflow completes {#wait-for-message-handlers}
See [Finishing handlers before the Workflow completes](/encyclopedia/workflow-message-passing#finishing-message-handlers).

If your Workflow has `async` Signal or Update handlers, then there is nothing to stop you allowing your main Workflow method to return or continue-as-new while a handler execution is waiting on an async task such as an Activity result.
However, this means that the handler may have been interrupted before it finished important work.
And if it's an Update handler, then the client will get an error when they try to retrieve their Update result.

You can avoid this by using `Workflow.WaitConditionAsync` to wait for [`Workflow.AllHandlersFinished`](https://dotnet.temporal.io/api/Temporalio.Workflows.Workflow.html#Temporalio_Workflows_Workflow_AllHandlersFinished) to return `true`:
```csharp
[Workflow]
public class MyWorkflow
{
    [WorkflowRun]
    public async Task<string> RunAsync()
    {
        // ...
        await Workflow.WaitConditionAsync(() => Workflow.AllHandlersFinished);
        return "workflow-result";
    }

    // ...
```

By default, your Worker will log a warning if you allow your Workflow Execution to finish with unfinished handler executions.
You can silence these warnings on a per-handler basis by passing the `UnfinishedPolicy` argument to the [`WorkflowSignalAttribute`](https://dotnet.temporal.io/api/Temporalio.Workflows.WorkflowSignalAttribute.html) / [`WorkflowUpdateAttribute`](https://dotnet.temporal.io/api/Temporalio.Workflows.WorkflowUpdateAttribute.html) decorator:
```csharp
    [WorkflowUpdate(UnfinishedPolicy = HandlerUnfinishedPolicy.Abandon)]
    public async Task MyUpdateAsync()
    {
        // ...
```


## Dynamic Handlers {#dynamic-handler}

Temporal supports Dynamic Workflows, Activities, Signals, Updates, and Queries.
These are unnamed handlers that are invoked if no other statically defined handler with the given name exists.

Dynamic Handlers provide flexibility to handle cases where the names of Workflows, Activities, Signals, or Queries aren't known at run time.

:::caution

Dynamic Handlers should be used judiciously as a fallback mechanism rather than the primary approach.
Overusing them can lead to maintainability and debugging issues down the line.

Instead, Workflows, Activities, Signals, and Queries should be defined statically whenever possible, with clear names that indicate their purpose.
Use static definitions as the primary way of structuring your Workflows.

Reserve Dynamic Handlers for cases where the handler names are not known at compile time and need to be looked up dynamically at runtime.
They are meant to handle edge cases and act as a catch-all, not as the main way of invoking logic.

### Set a Dynamic Signal, Query, or Update handler {#set-a-dynamic-signal}

A Dynamic Signal in Temporal is a Signal that is invoked dynamically at runtime if no other Signal with the same input is registered.
A Signal can be made dynamic by adding `Dynamic = true` to the `[WorkflowSignal]` attribute.

The handler must accept a string input for the name, and a `Temporalio.Converters.IRawValue[]` for the arguments.
The [Workflow.PayloadConverter](https://dotnet.temporal.io/api/Temporalio.Workflows.Workflow.html#Temporalio_Workflows_Workflow_PayloadConverter) property is used to convert a `IRawValue` object to the desired type.
For example:

```csharp
[WorkflowSignal(Dynamic = true)]
public async Task DynamicSignalAsync(string signalName, IRawValue[] args)
{
    var input = Workflow.PayloadConverter.ToValue<DoSomethingParam>(args.Single());
    pendingThings.Add(input);
}
```
